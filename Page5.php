  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">BRATACCAS is a self-contained 
    world. The first of the outer asteroids to be colonized; it was initially 
    used extensively as a forward base for exploration. As the years passed, Brataccas 
    became a favorite haunt of asteroid miners, the only place where it was possible 
    to break the tedium of their humdrum existence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">Prosperity bred corruption 
    and lawlessness. Organized crime moved in. Brataccas became a shadow world; 
    a dangerous place to venture into; a center of duplicity and double dealing. 
    An ideal cover for the activities of the corrupt government officials who 
    are Kyne's persecutors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">The human race moved 
    onward toward the stars. Brataccas now ostracized, had become a self governing 
    unit. A place of legend. Your only destination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">The incandescent clouds 
    of the teleport fade; you are now on Brataccas. You have little knowledge 
    of your mission. You know only that you stand tried and convicted in absence, 
    of a crime you did not commit -- 'The Crime Against Humanity'. Your only hope 
    is that somewhere within the depths of Brataccas lies proof of your innocence. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">But what is it? Where 
    is it? You can only guess.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">There is no help at 
    hand. The asteroid inhabitants understand only bribery, corruption and opportunism. 
    You are in danger; you must get moving; your only way forward is down the 
    lift and out of the arrivals bay.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">But what will you find 
    beyond the sliding door? Brataccas . . . . a world of mystery and surprise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">The framed picture of 
    an ABP patrol craft hanging on the wall reminds you that the Asteroid Belt 
    Police are never far away. You must keep moving . . . . whilst you stand still 
    other characters in this world are living their day. Whether yo like it or 
    not the world of Brataccas grinds on . . . . </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">There is only one way 
    forward . . . .</font></p></td>
