          HISTORY<br>
          <br>
          </font></b></u><font size="2" color="#000000">The game Brataccas does 
          not have a very pretty history. Most of it is fragmented. The game seems 
          to have a curse about it. In the early 80's there was a company called 
          Imagine based in Liverpool, England. Imagine had the great idea of making 
          a MEGA-GAME. They called it BANDERSNATCH. In the 80's the video game 
          industry was a flurry of rock star like programmers that appeared and 
          disappeared, leaving in their wake many games. Imagine was made up of 
          many such programmers. When the company went belly up the creators of 
          Bandersnatch pretty much disappeared. One former member of Imagine, 
          Ian Hetherington, went on to form a little game company called Psygnosis. 
          I believe (Someone please <a href="discussion.php">correct</a>
          me if I'm wrong) Brataccas was the first Psygnosis game. Psygnosis went 
          on the greatness and the legend that was Bandersnatch, that became Brataccas, 
          fell away somewhere in the Amiga/ST/Mac market...never to be seen again.</font></font></p>

          and the few that there are tend to be somewhat obscure. To the best 
          of my knowledge my page is the only page dedicated to Brataccas. If 
          anyone finds other pages that they feel are significant to the game

          was able to successfully disassemble the Brataccas MAIN and BRATACCA.PRG 
          files. It is available for download <a href="downloads/BratAssembly.zip">HERE</a>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          am attempting to start a project to have this converted to C++. Since 
          I don't know C++ that well and know nothing about M68K assembly, it's 
          not going well. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
          the moment my primary goal is to extract the original graphics from 
          these files (screen shots are not an option, there are way too many 
          NPC's in this game, not to mention the strange animation techniques 
          [how many times have you noticed that a characters arm will become detached 
          from his body as he draws his sword too quickly!?], besides, I'm looking 
          for perfect extractions, not rips.) By all means, however, if you feel 
          you have the skill to do this please feel free to. You are more than 
          welcome to post a message on my forum to announce the project if you 
          like. Just please make sure you intend on completing the project before 
          doing so.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
          you know M68K assembly and would like to take on this project post on the <a href="discussion.php">forum</a>,
          and have at it! It would be greatly appreciated if anyone would take 
          on any part of this task. The only thing I ask in exchange for using 
          the source code I disassembled is that you just let me know what you 
          are doing with it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          started a topic <a href="http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1675">HERE</a> 
          regarding the disassembly. As of this writing no one has taken on the 
          project.</font></p>
