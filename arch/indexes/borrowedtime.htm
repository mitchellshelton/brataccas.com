<BODY><FONT face=Arial size=4>Retrospective - Psygnosis<FONT size=3> 
<I>06/11/97</I> <BR><BR><FONT size=2>Psygnosis – There really IS no such word. 
<BR><BR>Psygnosis were associated early on with unusual games and for bringing 
about the adjective 'Psygnosisish'. No, really. To say that Psygnosis were 
always associated with good games is basically a lie, though. In the foetal 
stages of the Amiga revolution, Psygnosis produced some really <I>("displeasing" 
- Ed.)</I> software but it was always strangely stylish and memorable. I am 
going to make a leap of faith and presume that a company called Psyclapse was 
somehow associated with Psygnosis and eventually became part of the company or 
evolved into Psygnosis itself <I>(It was Psygnosis' offshoot which concentrated 
on arcade games whilst Psygnosis concentrated more on strategy games, fact fans. 
- Ed.)</I>. <BR><BR>To catalogue all of Psygnosis' and Psyclapse's software 
would be a mammoth task and far more research than I could be bothered to do for 
the amount of people actually interested. This was because Psygnosis eventually 
became more like an Ocean style company and hired many other software houses to 
produce titles under their name. To their credit however, they always produced 
quality titles and, until near the end of the Amiga (blasphemy?), didn't make 
movie tie-ins. I will just go through some highlights of their Amiga days and 
forget the many 'high quality produce, low playability" titles which probably 
makes up much of their collection.<BR><BR><B>THE DESTRUCTIVE YEARS</B> 
<BR><BR>My first taste of Psygnosis destruction came when my friend got his 
Amiga at a time when Commodore didn't package the Amiga with any games. Instead, 
he got a rather dubious mix of failed titles and this included two Psygnosis 
games called Terrapods and Obliterator <I>(This being the "Tenstar pack" and 
also contained Wizball, Amegas, Ikari Warriors and Buggy Boy - amongst others. - 
Ed.)</I> Terrapods brings vivid memories of trying in vain to figure out what 
the hell you had to do. Well, I still don't know what you had to do and so, 
apart from describing it as 'a kind of Operation Wolf with no recognisable 
objects in it', I can say little else about the game. It's amazing how much 
effort you will put into a game when it's a choice between it and Grid Start. 
That was the only reason I ever played Goldrunner. I couldn't believe somebody 
actually requested it at Lazarus <I>(That was me, you clot. - Ed.)</I> But 
that's beside the point. <BR><BR>Obliterator, on the other hand, was fantastic. 
The first hallmark of a Psygnosis game was its yearning music and Obliterator 
had a great musical score. It seemed to put grace, emotion and a strange sense 
of tragedy into what was basically a platform shoot-em-up. I don't know, maybe 
it gave you a sense of being alone in space and how highly the odds were stacked 
against you, or maybe I'm just being an arty prat. What was so ridiculous about 
Obliterator was the control system. Imagine playing Shinobi with a selection of 
icons which you had to click to make him move, jump and shoot. It sounds 
ludicrous but once you had acquired the pixel perfect judgement of a ninja it 
was strangely rewarding. It was a good game and Psygnosis did a similar game 
called Barbarian (no, not the one you're thinking of) using the same control 
system.<BR><BR>At around the same time they also released a game called Menace, 
which was probably their first notably great game from most people's point of 
view. Menace was a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up, similar to 
Nemesis/Salamander but with Psygnosis style and musical scores. The graphics 
were, and still are, great. The playability and difficulty were just right and 
the end-of-level bosses were awesome. If you can find it, this is a good blaster 
to use up an hour or two. I particularly liked the voice that told you what 
power-up you were getting, although, does anybody know what it was actually 
saying? <I>("Bonus", fact fans. - Ed.)</I><BR><BR><B>THE AMIGA SELLER</B> 
<BR><BR>I remember the ST/Amiga wars. They were bitter and relentless. If you 
left for school without knowing some facts about how the Amiga's graphics chip 
was FAR superior to the ST's then you were DOA. One game that helped change the 
tide and let the righteous Amiga take its rightful domain as the best 16-bit 
computer was Shadow of the Beast. It was one of the first 'Killer-Apps' to 
arrive on the Amiga and, by the time its sequel came out, the Amiga was a huge 
seller in the UK. No, for a long time it wasn't available on the ST and it was a 
sore point with any honest ST owner. The music was great, the graphics were 
gob-smacking and the playability was... OK. You piloted a beastie with a mean 
punch and kick around gorgeous parallaxed scenery and did battle with enormous 
sprites. Psygnosis' graphic style was complete and a guaranteed hit was secured 
if ever there was a sequel. Of course, there was a sequel and it looked better 
than ever but I'm sure the Terrapods designers were involved somewhere because, 
without the cheat, you didn't have a snowballs' chance in hell.<BR><BR>After the 
success of Shadow of the Beast, Psygnosis grew into a more prestigious company 
and started publishing titles by more software houses. The best move that 
Psygnosis ever made was to take on a Scottish software house called DMA Design. 
Along with a competent sequel to Menace called Blood Money, DMA came up with the 
idea of starring dozens of little lemmings that didn't look like lemmings in a 
scenario which would bring them much pain and suffering. You had to get the 
lemmings to their home without letting them (or a certain number of them..) come 
to any harm by using various ingenious techniques. The game's success was 
probably the combination of letting honest citizens save their furry little 
chums and letting dishonest citizens destroy them, and the scenery, in very 
violent and satisfying ways. Levels could be solved in many ways depending on 
the player's style and it made a cunning bridge between skill and puzzle 
solving. It also gave Psygnosis International fame and Lemmings got converted to 
just about every other computer and console system of the time.<BR><BR>Many 
annoying sequels were produced but never the ultimate 'Lemmings Massacre', which 
I think would have sold the most. You can see Lemmings influence in Worms, which 
has also been hugely successful and was also born on the 
Amiga.<BR><BR><B>FINDING A NEW HOME</B> <BR><BR>Time moved on and the Amiga 
failed to do so because of Commodore's laughably crap management. It all started 
with the consoles and Psygnosis was no different than any other company when 
they decided to try their hand at Sega and Nintendo's hardware. Aside from 
Lemmings, they failed to make much impression and although I don't know the 
details of Psygnosis at the time, they seemed to degenerate into nothing 
special. They may have needed some financial help because they were bought out 
by Sony who are now using them as a sort of in-house development team. Perhaps 
their final insult to the Amiga was one of their last releases on our beloved 
machine, which was, not only a movie tie-in, but also the biggest pile of 
("Swank" - Ed.) ever conceived. Last Action Hero wasn't a particularly good 
movie but it made an even less appealing game. Perhaps the only things that gave 
this title a mention in this article is that a) It really was crap b) It gave 
Amiga Power a chance to do one of their finest and funniest reviews of all 
time.<BR><BR>Maybe it was because Sony were using the quality staff or devoting 
more developing time to their Playstation titles but Psygnosis left the Amiga 
with a bit of a whimper. It has been great to watch Psygnosis regain their 
former glory on the Playstation over the last two years and also to see an 
English games software company doing so well internationally. Wipeout was a 
stylish game with fantastic music that I think helped games move away from a 
very poor image. If Psygnosis happens to have a job spare for an AI student who 
will graduate this year then I will be happy to oblige. Here's to Psygnosis for 
beating the Japanese companies at a game they can't play, honest to god mature 
style. <I><B>Jonathan Withey</B></I> </FONT></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
