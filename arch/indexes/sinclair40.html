<P class=first align=center><B><FONT size=+1>Whatever became of the Imagine 
team? Chris Bourne meets the folk who aim to put the Mersey back on the 
map</FONT></B></P><BR>
<P class=first>Once upon a time there were six happy Imagine programmers working 
their guts out on the legendary mega-game <B>Bandersnatch</B> up in 
Liverpool.</P>
<P>There was Ian Weatherburn, the games fanatic.</P>
<P>There was John Gibson, the ace programmer.</P>
<P>There were Steve Cain and Ally Noble and Karen Davies, the artists.</P>
<P>There was Kenny Everrett, no relation.</P>
<P>And there was a character at the top, where all the hype and the Ferraris and 
the duff cheques whirled about in a dust storm of vituperation and desperate 
attempts to keep going just another month, just another week, and his name was 
Dave Lawson.</P>
<P>"Do you want to know what the brief was for <B>Bandersnatch</B>?" asks Steve 
Cain. He's going to tell us anyway. "Dave Lawson came to us and said 'You've got 
four weeks to produce the best game graphics the world has ever seen'. That was 
all. We took four months and it still wasn't finished."</P>
<P>Then Imagine went bust, and the Bandersnatch team was out of a job, along 
with dozens of others who gave their soul for the most spectacular, romantic 
and, ultimately, sordid software company this country is ever likely to see. 
Dave Lawson and Ian Hetherington, both directors, wanted to keep the 
<B>Bandersnatch</B> team. They said they could get money in America.</P>
<P>Steve and Ian Weatherburn thought differently. "They told us the market in 
the UK was dead, you wouldn't get more than £5000 for a game tops, even if it 
was a number one."</P>
<P>They made a few phone calls and soon found out that the market was very much 
alive. "We talked to Bill Delaney at Beyond Software for half an hour and after 
that we were Beyond's men."</P>
<P>The idea was that Steve and Ian would set up a new company, Denton Designs, 
to write games for other software houses. For Steve, the attraction of Beyond 
had a lot to do with their products. "They had <B>Lords of Midnight</B>. 
Sometimes you see things by other people and you say 'I wish I'd done that'. 
Well, we thought we could produce things like that without having people of the 
calibre of Bruce Everiss around to cock it up for us."</P>
<P>Steve was anxious to include the other members of the team in the new deals. 
He'd been to college with Ally and Karen, and didn't want to see his friends 
sink without trace. The trouble was that most of them still wanted to believe in 
Dave Lawson. Then John and Kenny were served with writs along with Steve, so 
they joined up. After that, Ally and Karen came in.</P>
<P>"Beyond agreed to take two games from us, fund our development and premises. 
They wanted us badly but weren't prepared to take an almighty risk." Meanwhile 
Ocean was getting in on the act. The Denton team was turning into a hot 
property.</P>
<P>"All of a sudden up pops Steve Blower. He used to be at Imagine too, but he 
joined Ocean. Had we finished <B>Bandersnatch</B>? As far as we were concerned 
we were tied up with Beyond, and <B>Bandersnatch</B> would never see the light 
of day. But we met Ward, nevertheless."</P>

<P>David Ward, chairman of Ocean, told them not to worry about 
<B>Bandersnatch</B>. "Write a different game," he said. "Write one for me and 
I'll give you a contract for three and buy your old equipment from the receiver 
at Imagine." So Denton Designs signed up with Ocean as well and wrote <B>Gift 
from the Gods</B>. "It did OK, about 25,000 copies," says Steve. The game was 
designed in the main by John Gibson, and featured a large animated figure of the 
Greek hero Orestes searching a vast labyrinth for his sister Electra.</P>
<P>Denton Designs was split six ways between the original team, with everybody 
having an equal share. But Ian Weatherburn was unhappy. "For Ian, Imagine was 
heaven on earth," says Steve. "He wanted Denton to be just like Imagine. When we 
signed the contract to do <B>Shadowfire</B>, Ian said we had to do it his way or 
he would leave. So we sacked him. Actually, he's now working for Ocean."</P>
<P>Shadowfire, which we tipped as a <I>Sinclair User</I> Classic <A 
href="http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/039/sftwrea.htm#shadow">last month</A>, is 
the most impressive piece of software so far programmed by Denton Designs. An 
icon-based adventure, it dispenses with text and uses menus full of pictures of 
objects. You move a cursor around these pictures, or icons, to choose your 
action or movement.</P>
<P>The game is very much Denton's, although published by Beyond. "Beyond has 
never pressed us on a game, although they do test it, and say whether it has 
appeal," says Steve. "If we had a game and both Beyond and Ocean didn't like it 
we would respect that. They have a pretty good track record.</P>

<P>"On the Commodore 64 <B>Shadowfire</B> there was a bug. A phantom would 
appear and attack members of the Enigma team. We couldn't work out why, so we 
decided it was Zoff's pet. It turned out there was a spelling mistake on a 
single mnemonic in the machine code somewhere. We've taken the bug out now, so 
the bit in the booklet about Zoff's pet doesn't matter any more."</P>
<P><B>Gift from the Gods</B> was a direct descendant of <B>Bandersnatch</B>, in 
that it had a large animated figure wandering through the screens. But the icon 
system on <B>Shadowfire</B> was new. Ian Weatherburn conceived the idea of an 
icon-driven adventure back in the Imagine days, but nothing was ever done about 
it. Denton sees the icon system as something on which a whole range of products 
could be based.</P>
<P>"After Christmas we may change direction and move away from games." ruminated 
Steve. "The icons could be used to produce a library of routines for education 
software, and maybe special software for magazines and the like."</P>
<P>Commodore freak Dave Colclough joined Denton after Ian left, and more 
programmers have come in since. They are mostly ex-Imagine people - from Thor, 
set up by Imagine director Mark Butler, or Concept, a similar outfit to Denton 
but responsible for the Argus Mind Games series. A sense of déjà vu creeps in. 
Wasn't it this that went wrong at Imagine - growing too fast?</P>
<P>"We had to expand or go bust," says Steve, simply. "People say we shouldn't 
but we had to." Contract work demands it - you cannot afford to turn people 
down. If you haven't got enough programmers you have to hire some more. That's 
the theory, anyway.</P>
<P>Certainly Denton has been in demand. Apart from <B>Gift from the Gods</B> and 
<B>Shadowfire</B>, the list of credits includes <B>World Series Baseball</B> for 
Imagine 84, <B>Spyhunter</B> for US Gold, and, yet to be released, <B>Roland 
Rat</B> and <B>Frankie goes to Hollywood</B> for Ocean, <B>Shadowfire II</B> and 
<B>Bouncers</B> for Beyond, plus, no doubt, more secret projects.</P>
<P>The games fall into two categories. There's conversion work, like 
<B>Spyhunter</B> and <B>Roland Rat</B>, and there's Denton's own which seem to 
be considerably superior. The Frankie game, example, is Denton's own work, and 
quite superb. "Frankie was deigned by four non-games-playing people and that 
could prove to be really good," says Steve.</P>
<P>John Gibson, Kenny Everrett, Ally Noble and Karen Davis are the lucky 
quartet. Lest you find the naming of names boring, know that Steve and his pals 
are saddened by the lack of recognition given to the programmers and artists. 
"These days when you pick up a paper it shouldn't be 'Bill Delaney of Beyond 
says ...'. It should be 'Mike Singleton says ...'." It's a fair point; Mike 
wrote <B>Lords of Midnight</B>, and he's a freelance.</P>
<P>"It works because we're all close friends," says John Gibson, taking a brief 
break from his labours on Frankie. "We argue a lot and call each other names but 
we're still friends. If my games lack anything I suppose they lack 
gamesmanship."</P>
<P>"Your games don't lack anything at all," soothes Karen.</P>
<P>"No, it winds me up sometimes," says John. "A game like Elite's 
<B>Airwolf</B> gets slagged off by all the reviewers but gets to number two in 
the charts. Other games with rave reviews don't sell at all." Haven't the 
distributors and retailers got something to do with that? "Smiths and Boots are 
important, yes. I strongly object to people like Boots who say they won't stock 
a game because the box won't fit on their shelves."</P>
<P>If anything has crossed over from Imagine, it's the sense that programmers 
are creative people, artists in their own right, and that software is part of 
the entertainment industry. "It's just as creative as writing a song," says 
Steve. "I'm talking from experience." Mind you, Steve Cain never made any money 
out of his songs.</P>
<P>"I'd like to see designers and programmers seen as creative people. Software 
is too much regarded as a toy. The vital statistics of the end user are 
changing." What? They're getting fatter? "No, they're getting older. We need to 
appeal to people, of all ages, instead of just producing masses and masses of 
arcade-type games. Mind you, it's probably about time for an old-style 
shoot-em-up."</P>
<P>Games design does not come easily, according to Steve. The idea of having a 
team of characters in <B>Shadowfire</B>, the Enigma team, was so the player 
would identify with at least one. "Karen insisted the game needed a female 
character so we invented Sevrina," explains Steve.</P>
<P>The desire to include female characters and the like opens up some of the 
moral questions about games. Does Denton Designs have strong feelings about the 
sort of games they write particularly since the programs are written for other 
companies? After all, the company has worked for US Gold in the past, who 
brought out <B>Raid over Moscow</B>, criticised for its political overtones.</P>
<P>"We wouldn't see that sort of thing as a game idea in the first place," says 
Steve after much reflection. "There are definitely some people here who would 
feel unhappy about it, although I have no strong feelings myself."</P>
<P>Violence in itself however is not an objection. Christmas will see the launch 
of <B>Bouncer</B>, which is what Denton is calling a new game for Beyond on its 
Monolith label. "The game has gladiators of the future trying to propel a metal 
ball to a goal. There are eight character types to choose from and you can play 
against an opponent."</P>
<P>The success of Denton in a short space of time has much to do with the 
relaxed, enthusiastic attitude of the team. It is also a benefit not to have to 
worry about advertising, duplication, packaging, distribution and all the other 
expensive aspects of producing games which so often bankrupt software houses. 
Are we seeing the birth of a new type of progamming house, where publishers seek 
out the creative team they require for particular projects? Steve is quite 
convinced of the rightness of Denton's approach.</P>
<P>"It will be more important to our clients to have our names on the box than 
theirs," he says, confidently. At Imagine they tried to conquer the universe, 
and failed. Today they'll be happy with a decent slice of the market - and seem 
set to capture a lot more.</P><BR clear=all>
