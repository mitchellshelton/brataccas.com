<P class=first><FONT size=+1><B><I>Tucked away in the heart of Liverpool's 
Harley Street, down among the doctors, you can find Denton Designs. Not 'Denture 
Designs' as they're sometimes addressed by medical supplies firms, who can't 
believe that a software house could possibly set up shop in Rodney Street, 
Liverpool's medical heartland. Denton Designs.</I></B></FONT></P>
<H1>DENTON DESIGNS</H1>
<P class=first><FONT size=+1><B>As a Limited Company, Denton Designs came into 
being during September last year, and it consists of a nucleus of five people - 
John Gibson, Karen Davies, Steve Cain, Graham Everitt and Ally Noble. They first 
came together under the wing of the ill-fated Imagine where, amongst other 
things, they worked on the Megagames.</B></FONT></P>
<P>On 9th July 1984 the Imagine bubble burst. The crew that become Denton were 
made redundant, and suddenly found themselves embroiled in the wranglings over 
the rights to <I>Bandersnatch</I>. It seems the Receiver couldn't believe there 
was so little to show for the mega hyped games - little more than one disk 
existed, with most of the storyline and concept still inside the heads of 
programmers and designers.</P>
<P><I>Bandersnatch</I> and Eugene Evans went to Fireiron, the company founded by 
Messrs Lawson and Hetherington, and after a few week's planning Denton Designs 
was set up by the Founding Five. The company's first, and major capital 
investment was in the Sage computer systems used by Imagine to develop games, 
which download code into the target home micro. An office, a telephone, some 
clean paper and a few sharp pencils later, Denton Designs were in business.</P>
<P>'We just sat down and rang round the major software companies offering our 
services,' Karen Davies explains. 'We were surprised at the reaction we got from 
companies - it was invariably favourable. Business-wise people were naturally a 
bit wary at first, because of the Imagine reputation, but as programmers and 
artists we had a good grounding and reputation, and people <B>had</B> heard of 
us through the Imagine name.'</P>
<P>Although Denton Designs was set up as a traditional company, which means 
someone has to be Company Secretary, someone else Chairman and so on, it is run 
very much as a co-operative. There are no immediate plans for Dentons to publish 
software in their own right - the company acts very much as a facilities house 
offering the full range of services from straight conversions, through game 
design to an all-in parcel including conceptualisation, game design, programming 
and package design.</P>
<P>'We all work together,' Karen told us, 'we're not frightened to criticise 
each other's work, and no-one's a prima donna. There's no laying down of laws, 
with someone saying "I'm one of the directors so you must do what I say".' Which 
would be difficult - everyone in the team is ranked equally as 'Director' on the 
Denton business cards, and nobody's absolute boss in the office. 'We enjoyed 
working together and writing games together at Imagine, which is why we decided 
to stay together and continue writing games - it's good fun,' she added.</P>

<P>Argument, discussion, debate are all shared, with everyone participating in 
the work of the company as a whole. Each program, whether it is a conversion job 
('we try to squeeze them in between big projects as they pay the wages') or a 
major piece of work is treated as a project. Specific staff or freelance helpers 
are assigned to a project, but in reality everyone gets a say in the final 
product, passing comment as the work progresses.</P>
<P>So far Denton have converted <I>Spy Hunter</I> for the Spectrum and are 
currently working on implementing <I>Roland Rat</I> on the same machine. <I>Gift 
From The Gods</I> was their first large project, for Ocean. David Ward of Ocean 
wanted a new game in time for Christmas and went to Denton who put forward a 
couple of ideas. A choice was made, and Denton produced the game on 
schedule.</P>
<P><I>Frankie Goes to Hollywood</I>, previewed on the following pages by Dash Ed 
himself, was born from a very basic brief indeed: 'We don't want lots of 
Frankies running around, otherwise it's up to you' is the gist of what David 
Ward passed on as his requirement. And the end result is going to be pretty 
knockout, I assure you...</P>
<P><I>Shadowfire</I>, commissioned by Beyond and reviewed fully this issue, is 
the first major piece of work executed by Dentons that's already in the shops. 
'<I>Lords of Midnight</I> was one of the main spurs to Denton Designs - Mike 
Singleton is my hero,' Steve Cain explained, '<I>Lords of Midnight</I> is one of 
my favourite games and it prompted us to approach Beyond. We did everything on 
<I>Shadowfire</I> including the packaging design, story and system.'</P>
<P>'We did the visuals and a full specification for the game and then talked it 
through with Beyond,' Karen added, 'then we went away and change a lot if it... 
Beyond were well impressed when we showed them the finished product.'</P>
<P>'We do what we want to a degree - and it's nice to be able to choose who we 
work for - before signing contracts we talk about how we like to work, taking 
responsibility for the end product.'</P>
<P>'People are often a bit taken aback when they come and see us for the first 
time,' said Ally as we stumbled into their offices after the drive from Ludlow, 
made near-fatal by an utter nerd who nearly had us in a ditch, 'we're all a bit 
of a mixture... we're all different.'</P>
<P>Wacky and zany, zany and wacky? Well not really, just not quite fully paid up 
members of the collar and tie brigade. Steve Cain could be described as a 
'cyclical hippy' - he can't make his mind up whether he should grow his hair or 
keep it short. Every so often he scampers out, gets a super smart haircut and 
buys up half of Liverpool's mens outfitters' stock. Then his hair grows, and the 
image slowly changes back.</P>
<P>Karen, Ally and Steve all have an Art College background. Karen and Ally are 
the design mainstays who, like Steve, got involved in computer screen design 
when they joined Imagine. Karen, who was working on the C64 screens for 
<I>Frankie</I> when we arrived, trained in textile design which led her to a job 
in France. This was followed by a spell freelancing in Italy, then she returned 
to this country and was 'headhunted' into Imagine.</P>
<P>Ally Noble, on the other hand, the Queen of the Spectrum Screen (she'll 
murder me when she reads that) was a community artist type person who was 
working on a travelling video workshop project before going to Imagine for an 
interview. Ally met Steve Cain in the interview room and immediately started 
chatting to him about old times when they were at Liverpool Art College together 
- and despite their unusual approach to formal interviews, they were both 
hired!</P>
<P>Of the quintet, John Gibson's progress into games programming is probably the 
most spectacular. He was working in Cornwall installing suspended ceilings in 
offices when he decided to give it all up, move to Liverpool and enrol on a TOPS 
computer programming course. Newly qualified when he finished the course, John 
seemed destined to serve his time in the data processing bowels of some large 
company's mainframe installation.</P>

<P>Then, over a pint, he was asked by an Imagine person if he was a machine code 
programmer. 'Yes,' John replied, and he was hired on the spot. A few weeks later 
he was zooming round the streets of London in a company Porsche, getting paid a 
handsome salary for writing code on the Spectrum and watching the fire 
extinguisher fights in Chateau Imagine with amazement.</P>
<P>'I couldn't believe it,' he said, 'suddenly I'd got the kind of job my Mum 
was always on at me to get.' Sadly it didn't last too long - now there's not 
even a company C5 at Denton, and serious work is going on all day (and into 
quite a few nights).</P>
<P>Graham Everitt - 'Kenny' to all his friends, including his wife - was 
originally a carpenter. Like John, he changed trades and worked on a freelance 
basis for Imagine writing their systems software and developing utilities for 
the Sage machines. Now with Denton, Kenny is still the Main Man when it comes to 
sorting out the Sages, but he's started work on games programming too, and is 
currently working on <I>Frankie</I>.</P>
<P>Dentons have no plans to publish software in their own right just yet, 
although Karen admitted 'the more we get into it, the more we want to see a game 
on the shelves with the Denton Design name on it.' It's a matter of economics 
ultimately. Denton is not in a financial position to publish just yet. 'We had 
originally planned to sit down at the start of this year and assess our progress 
and make decisions about where the company should be going,' Kenny explained, 
'but somehow we never quite had the time. In the longer time we would like to 
bring out our own titles.'</P>
<P><I>Shadowfire 2</I> and a high speed, arcade-action sports game with detailed 
animation are the next two projects on the Denton Drawing board. A complete 
system, which could be used for educational programs as well as for games, is 
under development at Denton. <I>Shadowfire</I>, with its icons is part one, 
<I>Frankie</I> with the windows is part two and <I>Shadowfire 2</I>, which will 
have animated graphics controlled through icons will form part three.</P>
<P>A churlish observer would point out that icon driven software and windows 
zooming out of the screen are hardly innovative in themselves, having been 
well-established in business software. But it's the implementation that counts, 
and the way these features are incorporated into the game design which makes the 
Denton product outstanding. Anyway, no-one else had the programming or 
conceptual skills to incorporate windows in an arcade-adventure type of game, 
nor did the idea of having a non-text adventure see the light before 
<I>Shadowfire</I>.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the Five at Denton get a little peed off with the 
'Ex-Imagine' label that is so easy to apply them. After all, they're just as 
much ex-ceilling fitters and ex-community artists. No. Given the standard of 
their product, the innovative qualities of their game designs together with the 
enthusiasm they have for the job they do (which shows through in the software 
they produce) it's much fairer to say that Imagine was 'Pre-Denton'. So 
there.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
