<H2>Section 5 - Groups and Listings</H2>
<H3><A name=5.1></A>5.1. Which games have never actually been 
released?</H3><B>Mire Mare (Ultimate)</B> - It was mentioned at the end of 
Knightlore, Pentagram and Underwurlde. There were three exits from the 
Underwurlde. Depending on which one you took, the final screen was different. 
One of the screens announced Pentagram, another one Mire Mare, and the third one 
Knightlore. We can probably guess that the game will have looked pretty similar 
most of the other Ultimate games. 
<P>The June 1987 issue of SU reports that Mire Mare was still an ongoing project 
at the time. It was to be the next Ultimate game after Martianoids and Bubbler. 
Ultimate also reported that the game was to be followed by something they 
described as "Jetpac brought up to date". Maybe that last project was later 
canceled as Mire Mare was, or maybe it was taken over by the original Ultimate 
team to become the Jetman game on the NES. 
<P>One that's missing is <B>Death Pit</B> which was advertised by Durrell, I 
<BR>remember a double page ad with screen shots and it DEFINITELY never came 
<BR>out. 
<P><B>Staship</B> by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummon. The mysterious Pizza 
writes:- 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was just reading my old speccy magazines when an article about 
  Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond got my attention. In Your Sinclair Aug.'88 
  there's an article about JR &amp; BD's game which was never released. 
  <P>Quote: "A great loss, compounded by the fact that Starship (the name of the 
  game) looks well impressive, even at the stage at which it reached before 
  being abandoned. "The game that'll never be," Jon jokes as he loads it up. A 
  flying saucer zooms along above a smoothly-scrolling tessellated landscape, a 
  landscape that forms a globe and is complete with hills and mountains. The 
  playing area is huge - flying at full pelt in one direction, you go for about 
  45 seconds before circling the globe. Starship had the makings of a great game 
  - you wre going to be able to travel across the landscape in a variety of 
  vehicles, hunting for treasures and entering buildings to buy and sell 
  equipment. What a shame!"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>More info can be found in the <A 
href="http://www.icemark.ch/zx/SSD-II/">Sinclair Software Database</A>. 
<P><B>Psyclapse</B> and <B>Bandersnatch</B> (Psygnosis) were both never 
released. There was supposed to be a hardware add on to use them with and they 
were supposed to have amazing graphics including a caterpilla where each segment 
was animated individually (or something!) 
<P>Bandersnatch was Imagine's Speccy "mega-game" and was far from complete when 
the company went bust. Finchspeed sold the game rights to Sinclair Research and 
developed a complete QL version before folding -- Dave Lawson and Ian 
Heatherington then formed Psygnosis and the development team formed Denton 
Designs. The story was set in an inter-galactic nightclub on an asteroid, where 
buildings were linked by glass tubes across the surface. There were lots of 
interesting characters, including a fat bouncer (complete with bow tie) and a 
banana skin eating green worm (who inspired the green worm in Nodes Of Yesod), 
who communicated via speech bubbles. The game was a flip-screen 
arcade-adventure. The programming techniques (large sprites and flip screen 
special effects) and graphical style can be found in Denton Design's first game 
"Gift Of The Gods" (published by Ocean) -- as John Gibson (programmer) and Ally 
Noble (artist) worked on both games. Psygnosis revisted Bandersnatch for their 
first release, Brataccas (ST/Amiga). If you want to see Bandersnatch (minus the 
more original characters) load Brataccas into your ST/Amiga emulator. 
<P>Psyclapse was a C-64 "mega-game" by Imagine, but only really existed on paper 
before the company went bust. The only demo had the hero, wearing knee-high 
black boots, stomping along -- he was fixed in the centre of the screen (like 
Tir Na Nog) and a stoney wall background scrolled left and right. The hero was 
actually quite large by 1984 standards, using mutiple raster sprites. The story 
was about an evil villain who had transported warriors from throughout time to 
his fortress castle on a secret island, the object of the game was to escape. 
<P><B>Cyborg (CRL)</B> - Was previewed in magazines around 1987 but never came 
to light. 
<P><B>Attack Of The Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars</B> (starring 
Zippo the Dog) of course (Software Projects). <A 
href="http://icemark.ch/zx/SSD-II/ssd2show.cgi?dFile=a/aotmzcfm.ssd&amp;dSection=general+facts">Please 
see the SSD for more information</A>, but the brief version is that it came out 
as <B>Star Paws</B>. 
<P><B>Solar Jetman (Rare)</B>. Came out on the NES only. See the <A 
href="http://www.jonlan.demon.co.uk/spectrum/gamefaq/gamefaq6.htm">Ultimate</A> 
section for the full story. 
<P><B>Flashpoint (Ocean)</B> was actually written but never released. It ended 
up on the cover of an issue of SU and also YS. I can see why they never released 
it. &lt;- Opinion. Please ignore. 
<P><B>The Eye of the Moon</B>, Mike Singletons sequal to Lords of Midnight and 
Doomdarks Revenge. I have no information on this. Can anybody help please? 
<P><B>Scooby Doo</B> - well, IIRC it did actually get to the stage of being 
commissioned, and job being given to a programming company. They messed around 
with it for a while, actually beleiving that they could do it. When at last they 
realised that it didn't, they didn't tell Elite about it for a while. 
Eventually, it all collapsed and Elite had to start again and produced (IMHO) a 
fairly good game - the one that was released. 
<P>The original Scooby Doo was actually previewed in an issue of SU ( I believe 
). It was originally scheduled to be a long interactive movie style thing, and 
looked really good. But they ran out of RAM. 8-) SU's ``Gremlin'' column jumped 
on this and started the ``Scooby Awards'' for delayed games. 
<P><B>Streethawk (Ocean)</B> is a story all in itself. It was in fact released 
(very briefly) as part of a contract that Ocean had with a home shopping 
catalogue, Kays or something, but it was abysmal, and quickly changed for 
something else, although what, I don't know. The <I>real</I> StreetHawk was also 
properly released, although by then it was so late, nobody could remember who 
StreetHawk was, and it also didn't do very well... 
<P><B>The Siege of Earth trilogy by Gargoyle Games:</B> 
<P>Part 1: Marsport <BR>Part 2: Fornax <BR>Part 3: Gath 
<P>Sadly, part 1 was of course the only one to actually appear. I don't believe 
the next two even began to get written. 
<P>The story, briefly, was as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Marsport</B> 
  <P>The year: 2494. Earth is under seige by the ant-like Sept. The huge 
  force-field protecting Earth is beginning to fade, and the original plans must 
  be retrieved from the great city of Marsport, now occupied by the alien 
  Sept... Commander John Marsh of the Terran Liberation Forces battles against 
  the Sept Warlords and the robotic defences of M-Central in one last effort to 
  reach the plans inside the Marsport City Computers. 
  <P><B>Fornax</B> 
  <P>Fornax, the fire planet, is a world populated by Sept of the scientific 
  caste, who are studying the ancient Star Lord civilisation with the help of 
  mutated humans. The Terran Resistance must outwit the Sept brains and solve 
  the enigma of the Star Lords in order to uncover the greatest secret of all - 
  the location of the Sept Imperial planet, Gath. 
  <P><B>Gath</B> 
  <P>(Story presumably never written...)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>I got the above info from 
a Spectrum 128 promotional brochure which I still happen to own, which was (I 
think) given away with the computer when I bought it shortly after it was 
launched. The brochure details lots of games and hardware add-ons, including 
some games which never game out, such as Fornax and a 128K-only version of 
Dynamite Dan 2. 
<P>Other Gargoyle Games that were never written include the add-ons for <B>Heavy 
on the Magik</B>, more information on which is to come soon hopefully. 
<P>Beyond's <B>Star Trek</B> was the most famous Scooby award holder. It got to 
the mock-up screen shots stage and massive advertising, but nothing ever 
materialised of it. It was a very long running joke in Sinclair User. 
<P>I saw the Speccy conversion of 20th Anniversay Star Trek ST/Amiga game when I 
worked for Denton Designs. The 16-bit original was developed by ex-Dentonites 
and had extremely nice graphics (even by today's standards), however, the 
gameplay was not so hot. The third party 8-bit conversions didn't have the great 
graphics and were thus lame in the extreme -- it is absolutely no wonder that 
they did not see the light of day. 
<P><B>The Tebbit</B> - This was a combined shot at Melbourne House's The Hobbit 
and British politics (I think the name was taken from Norman Tebbit, although 
his position in the government escapes me). Ads for the game appeared in 
computer magazines. If memory serves, there was one in the May 1983 issue of 
Personal Computer World. I later (about 1987, I think) read in another mag that 
the game had been cancelled. 
<P><B>Atomic Robo-Kid</B> (Activision). The demo from YS was about 5 times 
slower than the coin-op. It was scrapped after Activision decided to shut up 
shop. 
<P>Then there is the <B>Great Giana Sisters</B>. I've been told that the game 
was never actually completed and that only beta versions of the game were 
reviewed. 
<H3><A name=5.2></A>5.2. Working Titles</H3>The following games all had their 
titles changed before they were actually released:- 
<P><IMG height=195 hspace=6 
src="../The%20Spectrum%20Games%20FAQ%20Part%205_files/twister.gif" width=255 align=right 
vspace=6> 
<UL>
  <LI>The game <B>Fantastic Voyage</B> was originally called <B>Blood and 
  Guts</B>, but was hastily changed when Quicksilva acquired the licence. 
  <LI>Foot &amp; Mouth became <B>Head Over Heels</B> (Ocean). 
  <LI>Twister, Mother or Harlots became <B>Twister, Mother of Charlotte</B>, 
  since the previous name was deemed too risque. 
  <LI>Mr Weems and the Sex Vampires became <B>Mr Weems and the She Vampires</B>. 
  This was originally going to be a game which people were allowed to copy and 
  sell on, giving a portion of the profits to the original publisher. It failed, 
  and was released as most games normally are, under the new name. 
  <LI>Splitting Images became <B>Split Personalities</B>. This was changed after 
  the threat of legal action from <B>Spitting Image</B>. YS reviewed the game 
  under the old name, and some copies were released before it could be changed. 
  <LI>The Adventures of Usaji Yojimbo became <B>Samurai Warrior</B>, presumably 
  on the orders of some marketing department. 
  <LI>Cats become <B>Paws</B> as soon as Artic failed to get the licence from a 
  certain Mr A. L. Webber. 
  <LI>There was a game from Fantasy Software which had to change its name due to 
  legal problems. It came out in the early years of the Spectrum, probably 1984 
  or something. I don't sure I remember the two names right, but it went like 
  this: the game was called <B>Hitchikers's Guide to the Universe</B>, and was 
  then forced to change its name to "Backpacker's Guide to the Universe" after 
  being sued by the company which detained the rights to Douglas Adams' books. I 
  seem to remember Fantasy Software even had to announce on Sinclair User (with 
  a paid ad) that the game had no relations with the book. There was an official 
  game from the book on other computers. It was a text adventure from Infocom. 
  </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=5.3></A>5.3. What hidden games are there?</H3><I>A hidden game is 
basically a game that is accessed from the main game by typing in some sort of 
cheat, and is normally completely separate in style to the game it is part 
of.</I> 
<P>&nbsp;<B>Booty (Firebird)</B> had a hidden game - it was a cheap'n'cheerful 
Scuba-Dive type game, but not nearly as sophisticated. To activate it you can 
either connect a Currah uSpeech unit, load the game, then wait for the attract 
mode to play all the way through, or try the pokes in the <A 
href="http://www.icemark.ch/zx/SSD-II/">SSD</A>. Anyway, then the diving game 
appears. 
<P>There is also a hidden game in <B>Starfarce (Binary Design?)</B>, but 
accessing it is unknown at this time. It tells you in an old issue of SU, if 
anybody cares to look, and it's reckoned to be quite good. 
<P>&nbsp;There is also one in the <B>Boggit (Delta 4)</B>. Apparently you type 
in <I>"Delta 4"</I> to get to it, but this must be in the second part (otherwise 
you get the message "Try again in part 2."). Unfortunately, to play part 2 you 
need to load a file from part 1, which is very difficult with a normal emulator. 
Does anyone have an "open" version? 
<P>&nbsp;<IMG height=195 hspace=6 
src="../The%20Spectrum%20Games%20FAQ%20Part%205_files/zub.gif" width=255 align=left vspace=6> 
There is a hidden game in <B>Zub 128 (Mastertronic)</B> and you can see how to 
access it if you go to pause mode. Pressing 2, 4, 6 and 8 will access the cheat, 
while pressing 1, 3, 5 and 7 will access a hidden game called <B>Light 
Farce</B>. However, this will only work with emulators that can read more than 
two keys at once. This game is exactly the same as the game <B>Zarjas</B> that 
appeared on the cover of Sinclair User, as part of their <I>Megatape 1</I> 
compilation. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>Everyone's a Wally (Mikrogen)</B> had an Asteroids game when you 
entered the Public Telephone. It also had a <B>Daley Thompson's Decathlon 
(Ocean)</B> style sprint where you raced against a fish. 
<P>&nbsp;In fact <B>Herbert's Dummy Run (Mikrogen)</B> was riddled with them. 
There is rumoured to be a space invaders clone with Daleks for invaders, a 
breakout clone using the tennis raquet, etc. 
<P>&nbsp;All the "hidden games" in MikroGen games, ie Wally etc, were in fact 
essential parts of the main game, and you had to clear a certain number of waves 
of aliens, etc, before a certain task could be completed. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>Short Circuit (Ocean)</B> has a space invaders machine in one of the 
rooms that you can play, providing you have found the 1 pound coin to put in it. 
If I remember rightly you had to get the 10p coin from the plant tub somewhere 
and then play the hidden fruit machine that was somewhere else, then you'd win 
the pound coin so that you could go and play the Space Invaders machine. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>Forbidden Planet (Design Design)</B> had at least 2 hidden games, 
`Whino Hunt' which you got to by pressing lots of keys during the game, and a 
reasonably acurate space invaders clone which you got by holding down a key as 
the game finished loading. 
<P>&nbsp;The Prequel to Forbidden Planet, namely <B>Dark Star (Design 
Design)</B>, had a sort of hidden game, except that it was more like a spoof of 
Teletext called <B>Spectacle</B>. It was accessed by loading the program on side 
2 and typing in "everyone's a nervous wreck" (case important). This is available 
as a snapshot in itself with Issue 4 of <A 
href="http://www.jetman.demon.co.uk/speccy/emulate/index.html">Emulate</A>. 
There is more information in the Spectrum Games Database entry. 
<H3><A name=5.5></A>5.5. A list of games series</H3>There are several series of 
games in the Spectrum game world, so to make sure that you are never left 
wondering what someone talks about when they mention the name of a series, this 
is a list. 
<P>&nbsp;<IMG height=195 hspace=10 
src="../The%20Spectrum%20Games%20FAQ%20Part%205_files/every.gif" width=255 align=right 
vspace=10 border=1> <B>The Wally Games</B> <BR>Automania, Everyone's a Wally, 
Three Weeks in Paradise, Herberts Dummy Run, and Pyjamarama. All were released 
by Mikrogen. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>The Magic Knight Games</B> <BR>Finders Keepers, Spellbound, 
Knight-Tyme and Stormbringer. All were released by Mastertronic, and programmed 
by David Jones. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>The Dizzy Games</B> <BR>Please see <A 
href="http://www.jonlan.demon.co.uk/spectrum/gamefaq/gamefaq1.htm#1.4">section 
1.4</A>. There's just too many to list again. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>The Monty Mole Games</B> <BR>Wanted: Monty Mole, Monty On The Run, 
Auf Wiedersehen Monty, Monty is Innocent, Impossamole and (maybe) Your Sinclair: 
Moley Christmas. All were released by Gremlin Graphics. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>The Horace Games</B> <BR>Hungry Horace, Horace Goes Ski-ing, and 
Horace and the Spiders. All were written by Psion, mainly William Tang. 
<P> 
<H3><A name=5.6></A>5.6. How did they get their name?</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Delta 4</B> - It was a joke suggested by Fergus McNeil's father, as 
  sounding quite sophisticated, and yet absurd at the same time, which is what 
  D4 was all about. Think about it... Delta is not only the fourth letter of the 
  greek alphabet, but also means "Triangle". How many four-sided triangles have 
  you seen recently? Sounds like the Greeks were mad to me. 
  <P>There was an early 1980s post-punk band from Leeds called the Delta 5, 
  named after the Mekong Delta. A subliminal influence, perhaps. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Any more please? </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=5.7></A>5.7. Game Styles</H3><B>Filmation 1 &amp; 2</B> 
<P>&nbsp;These styles of games were used extensively by Ultimate. The first one, 
Filmation, was basically an isometric viewpoint, allowing virtual 3D movement. 
The best example of this kind of game is Knightlore (Ultimate). 
<P>&nbsp;Filmation 2 was slightly similar. Its main difference was that it 
allowed the screen to be scrolled, and also allowed the character to walk behind 
objects, which became invisible when necessary. However, the platform aspect of 
these games was greatly reduced compared to those using Filmation 1. 
<P>&nbsp;<B>Windimation</B> 
<P>&nbsp;This was the menu system employed is many of of <B>Magic Knight</B> 
games. Using the keys, the options could be scrolled through or highlighted, and 
various options would lead to more options. For example, selecting "Pick up" 
would then lead to a menu of other objects that can be picked up. 
<H3><A name=5.8></A>5.8. Which Spectrum games <I>can't</I> be 
completed?</H3>Believe it or not, some bugged games cannot be completed without 
the use of pokes. These are the offending games, and, if known, why. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Jet Set Willy</B> - It is impossible to reach some objects. More 
  information is given in the <A 
  href="http://www.icemark.ch/zx/SSD-II/">Sinclair Software Database</A> JSW 
  entry. 
  <LI><B>Hive</B> - There are supposedly 8 levels, but only seven are accesible. 
  The game crashes before the 8th. 
  <LI><B>R-Type</B> - Some copies of the game do not have an eighth level. 
  <LI><B>Starion</B> - Well, according to the newsgroup, one of the anagrams you 
  had to solve was one letter longer than the 12 allowed by the game, so it 
  crashed when you got there - it was near the end (depended on the order you 
  chose to solve the game). A patch was released later by always-buggy Melbourne 
  House, but few people have ever seen it. 
  <LI>According to the author Mike Follin, <B>Subterranean Stryker</B>'s last 
  level can't completed due to a cock-up with the map editor. 
  <LI>According to <A href="mailto:robert.bak@bigfoot.com">Robert Baker</A>, a 
  game called <B>Fire and Ice</B> "was supposed to complete it by bringing 
  several special objects to the end location -- but most (or perhaps all) of 
  them got destroyed in the process, so it couldn't be done..." </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=5.9></A>5.9. How did the various magazines score 
games?</H3><B>Sinclair User</B> went through various scoring systems. Their 
first one was called <B>The Gilbert Factor</B> which I am reliably informed was 
out of 5. After this they went to a stright out-of-5-stars scoring system, which 
lasted until about 1988, whereupon they went to an out of 10 scoring system. 
This lasted a few years before they changed to a percentage scoring system, with 
various sub-scores for graphics, playability, sound and lastability. Most of the 
mags eventually went to this scoring system. 
<P><B>Your Sinclair</B> had it's own scoring system, and it also created other 
systems for when reveiwing certain types of games, mainly for things like a 
"Flight Sim Special" or their famed "Crap Games Competition". Most of the points 
for these were out of 100, but the sub-scores were for variously strange 
aspects. For example (IIRC) Alien Frighteningness (or something). Hopefully a 
few posts to the group will improve my memory.
