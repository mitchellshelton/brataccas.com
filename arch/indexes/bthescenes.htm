<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+2>W</FONT></FONT></B>hatever your 
gaming preference - adventure, arcade action, shoot'em up or strategy - you can 
doubtless point to any Psygnosis title as an example of "how it's done." But 
it's probably not the range of game genres for which you best remember 
Psygnosis, nor even the addictive quality of the games. Most likely, it's the 
graphics that stick in your mind. 
<P>At Psygnosis, graphics are all important. As John White, product development 
manager, puts it, "Unlike sound, you cant switch off a game's graphics; they are 
present from beginning to end of a game. First impressions count. Half the 
battle is won if the visuals are interesting." 
<P>Interesting visuals in games such as Arena, Cronous Quest and Barbarian first 
brought Psygnosis attention. Their Barbarian was arguably the first game to show 
the difference between 8- and 16-bit machines. While the sound and gameplay 
caused excitement, it was the graphics that really stood out, and still stand 
out today. The detailed backdrops, the animation, the comical sprites - it was 
the beginning of something special.

<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>The Sprite 
Brigade</FONT></FONT></B> <BR>Today that something special comes from their 
stable ot artists: Garvan Corbett, Jeff Bramfitt, Jim Bowers and Neil Thompson. 
(Editor's note: Thompson declined an interview since he joined Psygnosis very 
recently.) So strong is Psygnosis' commitment to graphics that it employs these 
four men full-time in-house, while using freelancers for coding and game 
development. The art team cleans up sprites and animations created by outside 
programmers, draws title screens and loading sequences, and designs the graphics 
for many games from scratch. 
<P>The artists use Commodore Amigas running Deluxe Paint III to do all the 
design work. Psygnosis chose the Amiga because it can emulate the ST's low 
resolution (320 x 200) 16-color mode, while the ST is incapable of emulating the 
Amiga's 32-color low-resolution mode. Once the artists have tweaked 16-color 
graphics designated for the ST, they give programmers Amiga disks containing 
images in IFF format for conversion and subsequent manipulation. 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>What, Me Hurry?</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR>Compared to most software houses, Psygnosis' working practices are odd. 
There is no rush to get the job done. A game is finished when everyone agrees 
they've done their best. 
<P>"There is no time limit when designing the graphics for a game," Corbett 
says. "I like to get the job done in six months, but it doesn't matter if it 
takes longer. It's getting the game to look good that's important." 
<P>The four artists have free reign over a game's graphics. They're given a 
rough story outline by the programmer or game designer, then the artists are on 
their own. They decide upon the look of every sprite, every animation, every 
background, the startup screen - everything.

<P>But that liberty is a two-edged sword. 
<P>"It's great having that sort of freedom," Corbett says. "What's not so great 
is coming up with the ideas." 
<P>Bowers agrees. "It's very easy to spend three weeks out of a month scratching 
your head looking for inspiration and the final week sitting down to draw." 
<P>Meticulous detail often clashes with space constraints; a lot of graphics end 
up shelved. "Designing computer graphics is much like writing," Bramfitt 
explains. "You can't get too attached to your work. Just as editors will chop 
text, so programmers and game designers will remove sequences of animations and 
sprites." <BR>&nbsp;

<P>Alter seeing his work end up in the pixel dustbin, Corbett doesn't produce as 
much now. Bowers, on the other hand, takes a philosophical approach. "Yeah, 
well, it's the way of the world," he says. 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>Who's Who</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR>Each of the Psygnosis artists generally works on a different project, 
although each has his own specialty that might he called upon from time to time. 

<P>Garvan Corbett joined Psygnosis five years ago on the recommendation of a 
friend who worked there. At the time he was enrolled in a government-sponsored 
workfare program, since the job market for artists was tight. All three 
illustrators, in fact, spent time on that workfare program; Bramfitt was 
Corbett's and Bowers' boss. 
<P>Corbett never used a computer for design work until he joined the software 
company. "The ST was the first machine I came in contact with and DEGAS Elite 
the first drawing package." So far he's been responsible for the graphics in 
Bratacus, Deep Space, Barbarian and Stryx. 
<P>Corbett's forte is designing cartoon characters. "I just love Disney 
cartoons, and especially Tom and Jerry," says the largely self-taught 28 year 
old. "I learnt so much simply by studying the animations." 
<P>It's easy to spot Corbett's work since, he claims, "big feet and outline 
graphics are my hallmark." According to one of the Psygnosis game testers, 
Corbett also enjoys producing pencil drawings of large, intimidating women with 
forked tongues. Unfortunately, Corbett wasn't willing to show off these. 
<P>Barbarian II is Corbett's latest project. He'll produce the animations for 
the characters and design the backgrounds. Since he illustrated the original 
Barbarian, however, he has a head start. 
<P>"Just as programmers build up libraries of source code," he explains, "so we 
accumulate disks full of characters and other graphics. It's possible to get 
away with the same ideas - and often the same characters - over and over again. 
Barbarian II is a great example. I was responsible for the first version and 
consequently have all the frames from the early game. Naturally there will be 
vast improvements to the sequel and the character you control will probably have 
100 frames of animation." 
<P>After his stint on workfare, Jim Bowers applied his art foundation coursework 
to sketching kitchen layouts for an interior design firm. Two and a half years 
ago, about the time he got bored with refrigerators and sinks, his friends from 
workfare offered him a job at Psygnosis. He, too, had never used a computer for 
design before, hut quickly grasped the overall scheme of things. 
<P>Bowers is a loading-sequence and 3D-design man. His work includes the loading 
sequences for Obliterator, Matrix Marauders (not released yet) and Infestation. 
He also crafted the 3D graphics in Infestation. 
<P>You'd be forgiven for thinking Bowers produced most of his work with help 
from a video digitizer. It's his technique. "I go for impression rather than 
detail," he says. "Shades and subtlety are what give my graphics their digitized 
look." The results speak for themselves. Unless you saw Bowers in action at the 
keyboard, you'd be convinced he hid a video digitizer and camera in his pocket. 
<P>Friendly rivalry exists between the artists. Jeff Bramfitt loathes video 
digitized graphics and cartoon characters with big feet. He prefers realism to 
surrealism. For the past year Bramfitt has been designing Carthage, a strategy 
game set in the Roman era complete with Ben Hur-style chariot racing. 
<P>Like Corbett, Bramfitt has a conventional design training behind him. 
Computers and art did not mix at the polytechnic I attended in Liverpool," 
Bramfitt remembers. "Indeed, computer art was and still is frowned on by 
illustrators and fine artists. 
<P>"Joining Psygnosis was a bit of a shock. I came to the interview, they sat me 
down in front of a computer and told me to draw a picture. I was there all day 
drawing this image pixel by pixel." 
<P>Bramfitt started life at Psygnosis three years ago designing title screens 
and death sequences. His work appears in Barbarian, Terrapocis and Aqua 
Adventurer. <BR>&nbsp;

<BR>None of the artists at Psygnosis used a computer for drawing before they 
joined the software firm. But then, they weren't hired for their technical 
know-how; they landed their jobs because they knew how to draw. 
<P>Their most difficult task is achieving realistic motion. Bowers tends to look 
at his reflection in the screen or gets someone to walk across the floor when 
animating a certain part of the body. Observation is extremely important, they 
say. Bramfitt studies the work of Eadweard Muybridge, a 19th-century 
photographer who produced countless books full of animals in motion. 
<P>Not all aspects of traditional art training are useful, however. Forget about 
using paper, unless it's graph paper. Sketching on paper can be deceptive, they 
warn; you never achieve the same smooth curves and lines on a computer simply 
because pixels are so blocky. "I only ever use paper when messing around - for 
throwing paper darts at Jeff and Jim," Corbett says. What a great idea for a 
game! Art Wars: three men launching and dodging a storm of deadly paper darts. 
The gameplay will be simple, and since Psygnosis will publish it, the graphics 
will he spectacular.
