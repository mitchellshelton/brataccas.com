            BREAK OF THEM ALL</B></FONT><BR><BR>A look at the crash of Imagine 
            Software as seen through the eyes of a film crew. Depending on when 
            you read this article, you may be about to see, have seen or maybe 
            missed, a fascinating program on BBC2 television (December 13th at 
            8.00pm) in the Commercial Breaks series about Imagine Software 
            Limited. The Liverpool software giant crashed out during the summer 
            after a life of a little over 18 months, during which time it 
            produced more hype than any other software house before. The company 
            appeared to bask in self-created publicity, much of which was very 
            clever, and it seems appropiate that its death should also have been 
            as well recorded for posterity by the media it sought for its 
            promotion, as had its successes in life. As things turned out, the 
            BBC film crew got a rather different story to the one they had 
            conceived, but much of the material shot for Commercial Breaks 
            cannot appear in the finished programme, because it falls outside 
            the scope of the series format. <BR><BR>Roger Kean spoke to BBC 
            director Paul Andersen as he was busy putting the finishing touches 
            to the programme. <BR><BR><BR><B>GIVE US A BREAK</B> <BR>Early in 
            the new year of 1984 BBC television director Paul Andersen, who 
            among other things was about to direct some of the programmes for 
            the Commercial Breaks series, witnessed the enthusiasm surrounding 
            some of the new generation of computer games that were beginning to 
            appear in the shops, and appreciated that the emerging software 
            houses were pioneering a new market. Commercial Breaks is a series 
            which broadly examines the struggles of individuals and companies 
            who are trying to 'break' a new product into the market place. To 
            Andersen the new computer games software 'moguls' seemed like a good 
            subject for a programme and he began researching, looking for a 
            suitable company to feature. <BR><BR>An obvious place to look was in 
            computer magazines, and it rapidly became apparent that Imagine was 
            a strong contender because of the spate of clever advertising that 
            was then appearing which was designed for Imagine by Stephen Blower 
            of Studio Sting, an offshoot company of Imagine, coupled with the 
            fact that Andersen, like so many people in Britan, was reading the 
            national press publicity about Imagine's teenage programmer Eugene 
            Evans, who was said to be earning £35,000 a year and could afford a 
            fabulously expensive car when he was still too young to drive it. 
            There was obviously a story here for Commercial Breaks. <BR><BR>The 
            next step was to approach Imagine and ask the owners wether they 
            would mind being featured. So Andersen travelled to Liverpool and 
            spoke to the young bossess of the new company, Mark Butler and David 
            Lawson. Lawson had written Arcadia, Imagine's biggest hit at the 
            time, and Butler had sold it into shops starved of software over the 
            82 Christmas. At first they seemed reluctant, and Imagine's 
            Operations Manager, Bruce Everiss, explained that there were too 
            many things under wraps to allow in the prying eyes of television. 
            On the other hand the publicity-eager Everiss must have been able to 
            see the promotional capital that could be made out of having BBC TV 
            hanging around for some weeks making a film about them. Dave Lawson 
            saw another angle altogether, and to appreciate this it's worth 
            remembering what put Liverpool on the map in the early sixties. 
            <BR><BR><BR><B>BIRTH OF AN INDUSTRY</B><BR>The Beatles transformed 
            British (and then world) pop music in the early sixties, and created 
            a modern myth about Liverpool, their home city. Over the years 
            Liverpool has come to see itself as a possibly undernorished and 
            underpriviledged city, but one bursting at the seams with 
            imagination and guts. With the eighties something similar to the 
            Beatles seemed to be happening, only in computer software this time, 
            and Dave Lawson must have seen Imagine as being at its very centre. 
            Stephen Blower said that, 'Lawson had some greater vision of what 
            could be produced in software than anyone else I've ever met.' 
            <BR><BR>At the time when Paul Andersen approached them, Imagine was 
            working on the concept of megagames, having exhausted the 
            possibilities of the home computer's limited memory. Lawson, who was 
            largely responsible for overseeing their development, saw that the 
            BBC would be able to record for posterity the concept, development 
            and creative effort of a dedicated team in bringing these new super 
            games out. In a way, the Imagine team, and especially the men who 
            ran the operation, would be seen to be ushering in a new Beatles 
            era, but in software rather than in music. For the TV director the 
            megagames also offered an essential linch pin on which to hang his 
            programme. It all seemed ideal and, at the time neither party knew 
            how dramatically different things would turn out. <BR><BR>When the 
            BBC film crew went in to start shooting material for the programme 
            they realised that Imagine made good visual material; huge, 
            luxurious offices, acres of carpet, computer terminals by the ton 
            load, lots of young programmers, secretaries in abundance, young 
            'gophers' acting as runners for the management and a company garage 
            packed with a fleet of Ferrari Boxers, BMWs for the lesser 
            executives and the famous Mark Butler custom hand-built Harris 
            motorbike. At the time Imagine was employing 103 members of staff. 
            Andersen had a funny feeling that it all looked too good to be true 
            - and it was. <BR><BR>He noted that beneath the energy and bustle 
            there were inconsistancies. Principal of these was an apparent split 
            in the senior management which meant factions were working against 
            each other. But the first noted disrepancy in the outward bravado 
            was that Eugene Evans had obviously never recieved anything like his 
            £35,000 a year quoted in the PR story. But what seemed more 
            suprising to Andersen was that Evans had never really written any 
            programs either - certainly nothing that Imagine cared to publish. 
            This might not have suprised some of his contempary Liverpudlian 
            programmers who were working for other software houses, however, who 
            knew much better. <BR><BR><BR><B>THE GROWING SPLIT</B><BR>Eugene 
            Evans, like Mark Butler had worked at Microdigital, one of the first 
            ever British computer stores, situated in Liverpool. Bruce Everiss 
            was also associated with Microdigital, and so were many of the 
            programmers who were later to become the bedrock of the Liverpool 
            software business. They all knew each other pretty well. It was the 
            sort of in-bred atmosphere which leads to personality clashes, and 
            soon enough the BBC team began to see evidence of them. <BR><BR>The 
            disparity between the publicity hype and the reality became 
            increasingly apparent during the summer months. Central to the 
            problem was the fact that both Mark Butler and Dave Lawson had 
            catapulted to fame and fortune within a few months. They would have 
            been super-human if they had not come to believe a little in their 
            own publicity and both in their different ways appear to have failed 
            in coping with the fortune. Mark Butler's background after leaving 
            Microdigital was as Sales Manager for Bug-Byte software where Lawson 
            also worked as a programmer. They both left to set up Imagine in a 
            small front room after several disagreements with the Bug-Byte 
            management. The money that the sales of Arcadia made over the 
            Christmas of 82 was reinvested in bigger premises, personnel and in 
            new programs, which also sold well. Naturally, the two young moguls 
            needed staff and management to help administrate the in-pouring 
            fortune, a classic stuation which encourages the development of 
            court chamberlains. One of the first such was Bruce Everiss, who 
            seems to have naturally attached himself more to Mark than to Dave. 
            Everiss was responsible for the day to day running of the company, 
            but the responsibility for financial control and a directorship was 
            put in the hands of Ian Hetherington. Hetherington attached himself 
            to Lawson. The factions had begun. <BR><BR>One of Mark's hobbies is 
            fast motorbikes. He created the Imagine racing team and himself rode 
            on the track. In fact Paul Andersen and the BBC crew were at the 
            Isle of Man TT races in June filming at a time when Imagine was 
            already in serious trouble and teetering on the brink of a crash. 
            Mark did suffer a crash. Ironically he was driven to the 
            dismemberment of his empire swathed in bandages. <BR><BR>According 
            to Andersen (a view backed up by many other observers), the two 
            bosses thought that because of their success in the field of games 
            production, it meant they could handle all sorts of other businesses 
            as well. Almost at the outset they founded Studio Sting, together 
            with Stephen Blower, the designer whose art work helped sell the 
            company's image and which adorned Imagine covers. Studio Sting was 
            to act as a design centre and advertising agency for Imagine, which 
            meant the company would be entitled to a discount on ad space booked 
            in magazines. In return Stephen Blower recieved a 10% share of 
            Imagine (which wasn't worth all too much when the share was gladly 
            handed over). Within a few months this situation has changed and the 
            10% was worth a lot on paper. The triad of Butler, Lawson and 
            Hetherington wanted things rationalised - ie, they wanted the 10% 
            back. There are many rumors attached to the goings on at this time, 
            in-fighting appears to have been rife, but whatever actually took 
            place, the outcome was that Studio Sting was left holding huge 
            magazine advertising debts (which have remained upaid) but Stephen 
            held onto his 10%, although he lost any executive post within 
            Imagine. He therefore lost control over his own destiny when 
            management decisions led to its downfall, and is still undergoing 
            legal wrangles between himself and Butler/Lawson as to his financial 
            responsibilities in the matter of Imagine's vast debt. <BR><BR>In a 
            telephone conversation with <I>Crash</I>'s Kevin Foster, Blower 
            said, 'Imagine tried to accuse me of certain things I didn't do. For 
            instance, they said that I was detrimental to the company's image 
            and I was booking advertising space that wasn't wanted. I was 
            accused of stealing, or misappropiating £10,000, and my wife was 
            accused of being incapable of keeping the books at Studio Sting. All 
            this was later disproved in court.' <BR><BR>He went on to say, 'They 
            were obviously after my 10%. Imagine owed Studio Sting £89,000, so 
            the way I see it is that they attempted to brush that debt under the 
            carpet. The allegations were just an attempt to condone their own 
            actions. I was probably the only one at Imagine who stuck to doing 
            what he was best at doing.' <BR><BR><BR><B>THE MEGAGAMES 
            </B><BR>Late in 83 Imagine had set up a deal to produce games for 
            publishers Marshall Cavendish which may have been worth as much as 
            £11 million to Imagine. Early in 84 the contracts were signed, but 
            even before Andersen had received the co-operation of Imagine to 
            start shooting there were signs that all was not well with the deal. 
            By the time the BBC crew was installed it was clear things were 
            going badly wrong. The megagames had intervened. Dave Lawson who, 
            according to Bruce Everiss, always insisted that the programmers be 
            left strictly alone, free to create without management interference, 
            wanted to concentrate on the development of the megagames. Marshall 
            Cavendish became disenchanted by the lack of progress on their 
            games. They had already paid out a lot of money and seem to have 
            been unhappy with the quality of what was ready. They pulled out and 
            wanted their money back. But Imagine had taken on more people to 
            cope, programmers, artists, musicans, gophers. None of these was 
            laid off, the overheads went up alarmingly. <BR><BR>Meanwhile the 
            megagames were not progressing as well as it was originally hoped 
            they would. Andersen noticed that John Gibson was working hard at 
            Bandersnatch with Ian Weatherburn, but Psyclapse was nowhere, 
            nothing more than a paper idea. Yet at this stage the artist Roger 
            Dean (famous for his record album sleeves and mythological books) 
            had already designed the boxes and ads which were beginning to 
            appear. Dean reputedly asked £6,000 for this job, and Andersen 
            thought he was 'smart enough' to have demanded it up front. 
            <BR><BR>An important problem with the megagames was that they 
            required a hardware add-on which was to be made in the East. To get 
            the price right, enormous quantities would have to be manufactured. 
            Imagine did not possess the money any more, and anyway could not 
            have sensibly decided how many games would eventually sell. There 
            was indecision all round. Bruce Everiss was to say later, 'One 
            option that we have is to sell the company as a whole to Sinclair 
            Research, and I've been speaking to Sinclair Research, and they're 
            not interested. They're saying that they want to keep programming of 
            that nature outside their company.' <BR><BR>It transpired that 
            Sinclair Research was only interested in buying finished product and 
            that the megagames would have to be designed to work on the 
            micro-drive, because they would not undertake the production of 
            masses of hardware add-ons. In the event Sinclair Research did buy 
            an option on Bandersnatch for the QL computer to go on micro-drive. 
            <BR><BR>Another interesting rumour that Paul Andersen's film team 
            were able to verify, was what occured over the Christmas period of 
            83. In 1982 there had been a software shortage in the shops. 1983 
            was to be a boom time, and Imagine decided on a clever ploy to foil 
            the duplication of their rivals tapes. Ahead of time they booked the 
            entire duplicating capacity of Kiltdale, one of the biggest 
            duplicators for the software business. The idea, obviously, was to 
            make it impossible for other major companies to get enough tapes 
            duplicated for the Christmas rush. On paper it looked like an 
            elegant a piece of industrial sabotage. In practice it backfired. 
            Imagine ended up hiring a warehouse for the storage of the hundreds 
            of thousands cassettes that they ended up with. After Christmas, the 
            bottom fell out of the market, and there was no way they could shift 
            the games. This was a principal reason behind the strange move to 
            lower the price of Imagine software. It also backfired because they 
            had flooded the shops with non-selling tapes, and then expected 
            everyone to like the fact that the tapes would have to be sold at a 
            price lower than the wholesale price the shopkeepers had bought the 
            tapes for in the first place. <BR><BR><BR><B>THE SCRIPT CHANGES 
            </B><BR>So in the middle of shooting a TV programme about a company 
            that was going places fast, Paul Andersen found himself filming one 
            with a huge staff it no longer needed or could afford, sitting on a 
            vast stock of product it could not sell, with programmers left to 
            their own devices much of the time and producing games that were 
            completely unplayable and usually released with bugs still in them 
            (remember Stonkers), run by a management team that was beginning to 
            fall apart at the seams. Andersen recalls filming a meeting where 
            the bosses sat around deciding how large the megagame boxes should 
            be, wether they should be huge to entice punters to fork out £30 to 
            £40, or wether the large size would put buyers off on the grounds 
            that everyone knows model kit boxes are usually full of air. And 
            this at a time when their empire was literally falling apart through 
            lack of money and mounting debts. Lawson was buried in his 
            megagames, Butler was acting out the role of playboy in his Ferrari 
            and at the bike tracks. Everiss was trying to keep the offices 
            running, while the rest of the 'top management team' struggled to 
            cope with the increasing bitterness that was developing between the 
            triad at the top. Some of the effects of what was happening were 
            apparent to outsiders as well. I recall visiting Imagine for a 
            meeting with Dave Lawson and Bruce Everiss sometime in late April. 
            Lawson never turned up and Mark Butler appeared for a few moments, 
            having just popped into the building to pick up some petty cash. It 
            seemed a bit odd. The resulting article which appeared in 
            <I>Crash</I> naturally quoted Everiss the most. When the issue was 
            published Butler rang me to complain that the emphasis was wrong - 
            it made it sound like Everiss ran the company, he told me, when in 
            fact he and Dave were still in charge. <BR><BR>As early as 16th 
            April 1984, a petition was presented to the High Court by Cornhill 
            Publications Ltd, to have Imagine Software Ltd wound-up for 
            non-payment of debts. At the time of writing I have been unable to 
            establish what these debts were, or how they were incurred. The 
            matter was 'heard' on the 11th June, three of four days before the 
            TT races. On Monday 9th July at the High Court of Justice (Chancery 
            Division) a futher petition to wind-up Imagine on behalf of VNU 
            Business Press (publishers of Personal Computer Games among others) 
            went unopposed. Imagine was finished. <BR><BR>But what was happening 
            back in Liverpool? The BBC crew were filming right up to the last 
            moment, and witnessed the apathy and confusion that attended the 
            last days. A memorable scene is the man from Kiltdale the 
            duplicators, walking up and down Imagine's offices trying to get to 
            see either Butler, Lawson or Hetherington, the only people who could 
            pay him the £60,000 owed by Imagine, much of it for the mass 
            duplication done over Christmas in an attempt to prevent other 
            software houses having games ready. He was in despair. But Mark 
            Butler was not available, and the Lawson/Hetherington faction had 
            disappeared. <BR><BR>According to Bruce Everiss, they had already 
            made their plans well beforehand, and events would appear to back 
            him up. What he told Paul Andersen, is substantially the same as 
            what he told me over the phone back in July. 'I'm not a signatory on 
            the bank or anything, but I've had a look at the financial records 
            of the company and there has never been a VAT return (Imagine had 
            been running for 18 months and should therefore made at least 6 VAT 
            returns by law), never a bank concillation, never a creditor's 
            ledger control account, never any budgeting, never any cash-flow 
            forecasting, no cost centres, not even an invoice authorisation 
            procedure. Just no financial controls at all.' <BR><BR>All these 
            financial aspects were supposedly the responsibility of Ian 
            Hetherington. Paul Andersen recalls that Heatherinton was usually 
            unapproachable during filming and had little if anything to say to 
            the film crew. <BR><BR>Is it possible that Hetherington has already 
            sussed out the true financial position right at the start of his 
            tenure? It would be odd if he hadn't, since the cracks were there 
            even before Christmas 83. What must surely have occured to him is 
            that Imagine was capable of making a lot of money, and that the 
            megagames were going to make them all very rich. A lot of Imagine 
            was now defunct and wasting money. Debts were getting to be 
            astronomical, various attempts to raise money in the City had 
            failed, or been abandoned. If the company went, so would the 
            investment in the megagames, so too would their personal finances. 
            <BR><BR>Everiss again: 'Dave has become anxious about losing his big 
            house in Coldy and about his kids at expensive schools and Ian has 
            become greedy and wants to become a millionaire overnight. So Ian 
            has presented this Finchspeed plan to Dave. Dave, grasping at 
            straws, has taken it on board - which means that only 20 people will 
            be employed.' <BR><BR><BR><B>THE RESCUE PLAN </B><BR>Finchspeed. The 
            name first hit the press after the Imagine collapse. Finchspeed was 
            the new company founded by Dave Lawson and Ian Hetherington for what 
            appears to be the express purpose of aquiring all the Imagine 
            assets. As a result of canvassing opinion and currying favour with 
            those programmers whom Lawson and Hetherington considered 
            'sympathetic' to them (rather than to the Butler/Everiss faction), 
            jobs were offered to approximately 20 people - in fact those needed 
            to continue work on and complete the megagames. <BR><BR>At the time 
            the Finchspeed documents were drawn up, very few people knew about 
            the Lawson/Hetherington plans. It seems Mark Butler had no idea and 
            Bruce Everiss certainly didn't. 'They didn't tell Mark about this 
            till the very last minute when they let him in on a third of 
            Finchspeed,' Everiss told Paul Andersen later. It seems incredible 
            that the duo thought they could get away with transferring assets 
            from a company part-owned by Butler, without his knowledge. Stephen 
            Blower was also in the dark. Later he was to be held jointly 
            responsible in law for Imagine's debts. He told us, 'I'm still 
            liable for the overdraft, which was £112,000 at the last count. If 
            it came to court I think I would have a good case against them, as 
            has been shown last time I took them to court.' Blower appears to 
            have maintained that Butler and Lawson should have protected his 
            interests better, and the courts have agreed. Butler and Lawson were 
            ordered to pay Blower back the £89,000, but failed to do so. At a 
            later hearing the Judge said that he ought to send Butler and Lawson 
            to jail for refusing a court order to pay, but they were let off on 
            the grounds that in jail they would be unable to put matters right 
            and that it was in the best interests of both parties if they were 
            allowed to continue their present work to be enabled to pay Blower. 
            <BR><BR>Although the Finchspeed arrangements were made in secrecy, 
            it did not quite escape the notice of the BBC team, who actually 
            filmed Dave Lawson signing a legal document relating to some aspect 
            of Finchspeed. This shot appeared in the 'rough cut' of the 
            programme (at the time of writing it is not known wether it 
            remains), but because this deal was largely outside the scope of the 
            programme, the shot is just there as visual background. <BR><BR>On a 
            later occasion the film crew were also present when Dave Lawson's 
            wife came into his office to get papers signed for a passport 
            shortly before he left for America with Hetherington. With the 
            winding- up orders going through the courts unopposed, Lawson and 
            Butler prepared to disappear from the scene. <BR><BR>On the 
            telephone, Hetherington told us 'I didn't run away anywhere. I spent 
            four weeks, day and night, writing a business report. I was in 
            America for fund-raising, and we were damn near successful, but we 
            had to have our trip cut short because of the goings-on at Imagine.' 
            He added, 'I am sick to death of people insinuating that anything 
            untoward happened at Imagine.' <BR><BR>In retrospect it seems 
            incredible that they should leave the country at such a time, unless 
            one supposes that they felt unable to face the imminent disaster. 
            Protests that the trip was a realistic fund-raising exercise for 
            Imagine seem undermined in the face of writs going unopposed through 
            the law courts before and during their trip. As soon as the two men 
            had gone, numerous creditors, trying for weeks to get some reply to 
            their demands for overdue payment, were stumped, because with Lawton 
            and Hetherington gone, there was no-one to cope with the financial 
            problems. It's [line missing] or three days later before the 
            assembled staff and told them in a brief speech that it was over, 
            that he hoped they'd get paid what they were owed if it was 
            possible, and that he would try to find alternative employment for 
            as many as possible. During the period between Lawson and 
            Hetherington vanishing and the baliffs arriving, life in the Imagine 
            HQ appears to have been as disorganised and dream-like as it was in 
            Hitler's Berlin bunker. In reply to Paul Andersen's question about 
            what had been happening, Everiss replied: 'Well, there was a whole 
            pile of people just playing games there and they're hiding from the 
            camera. If you go round the corner here, by the exit, you'll find 
            there's a big pile of empty fire extinguishers because there's been 
            fire extinguisher fights all week. That's been the main event.' 
            <BR><BR>As far as the BBC team could see, the staff were mostly 
            sitting around, watching videos and waiting for the end. Everiss was 
            left with trying to find jobs for about 60 staff, those left behind 
            by the new Finchspeed crew, and in the end he felt morally obliged 
            to resign. 'Dave and Ian, being too much of cowards to face up to 
            me, have told Mark that they wouldn't want me here when they 
            returned,' he said. <BR><BR>That was largely it for Imagine Software 
            Limited, but not for the people involved. Finchspeed has gone on to 
            develop the megagame Bandersnatch for Sinclair Research to bring out 
            on the QL in the New Year, with a royalty from each unit sold going 
            back to the Imagine liquidators to help pay back to company's debts. 
            It is a critical time for its directors, Dave Lawson and Ian 
            Hetherington, who are naturally afraid of any adverse publicity. 
            Even as I was in London seeing the rough cut of the TV programme, 
            Ian Hetherington was on the phone trying to get hold of Paul 
            Andersen. When I returned to Ludlow that Friday evening, I was 
            greeted with a message that Hetherington had rung me to find out the 
            same thing, having heard that we were writing the story. 
            Unfortunately for him, he spoke to our Financial Director, and was 
            told that as he still owed us £5,825, it wasn't sound sense to 
            bother us! <BR><BR>We phoned him on the following Monday morning, 
            when he spoke to Kevin Foster and gave him the quotes used in this 
            article. He also implied that if we printed anything he didn't like, 
            we would be making him a rich man. Implications of libel action are 
            all very well. The fact remains that <I>Crash</I>, along with other 
            publications had been promised payments by both Imagine's 
            promotional department and (in our case) by Hetherington personally. 
            These never arrived. But at the time, he and Lawson were signing 
            assets out of Imagine into another company. Hard to accept 
            Hetherington's comments to us at face value when (whether intended 
            or not) his absence put a total block on payments. Yet equally it 
            must have been clear to him that payments could not be met. 
            <BR><BR><BR><B>WINDING DOWN </B><BR>With knowledge that VNU had 
            succesfully issued a winding-up order on Imagine, the rest of the 
            company's creditors began jamming the switchboard to find out what 
            was going on. <I>Crash</I> was one of them. The official line was 
            that things were quite normal. But no one knew where Lawson, 
            Hetherington and Butler were. Everiss told Paul Andersen, 'Mark 
            didn't know where they'd gone. The only person they told was Andrew 
            Sinclair, who basically's just David's gopher, and Andrew has been 
            spying on Mark and myself and reporting on a daily basis to them in 
            San Francisco.' One press mention did suggest that the two directors 
            were in the States trying to raise venture capital in Silicon Chip 
            Valley to save Imagine, but this would appear to be out of character 
            with their recent actions in moving assets from Imagine to 
            Finchspeed, and gives strength to Bruce Everiss who said, 'All 
            they're trying to do is finance Finchspeed with capital from San 
            Francisco.' The significance of the passport signing became more 
            apparent when it was realised that both men had taken their wives 
            with them on the trip to America at a cost estimated by Everiss to 
            be possibly as high as £10,000, and that at a time when creditors 
            were crawling all over the building trying to get paid. <BR><BR>On 
            the day Mark returned from the races, wrapped in bandages and driven 
            by someone else, he arrived at Imagine headquarters to find the 
            bailiffs were in. One of the items they impounded was his pride and 
            joy, the Ferarri Boxer. Paul Andersen recalls that he seemed stunned 
            and totally out of his depth. He didn't know what to do or wno to 
            blame, it seemed he was genuinely unaware that things had reached 
            such a state, or that his co-directors had fled the country and were 
            in hiding (as everyone said), incommunicado. So closely did the TV 
            crew follow the proceedings that they almost had their camera gear 
            locked into the building by the bailiffs! <BR><BR>Mark went off, to 
            return two which they both part-owned at a time when Imagine was 
            hoplessly in debt, and desperately required those assets if it was 
            to have a hope of staying alive. Recognition of this fact can be 
            seen in that a royalty on every copy of Bandersnatch sold by 
            Sinclair will be going back to Imagine's liquidators. <BR><BR>Some 
            of the programmers are now working freelance on games for Ocean, and 
            others, including John Gibson have founded a new Liverpool company 
            with partial backing from Ocean called Denton Designs and their 
            first game, an adventure entitled Gift From The Gods should be 
            released through Ocean shortly. Mark Butler is working with his 
            father in another software company called Voyager. Stephen Blower 
            worked for the year as a freelance and is now at Ocean, where he has 
            recently been made a director. Of the collapse of Imagine he had 
            this to say, 'Through greed, or little boys playing at big business, 
            or whatever it was that carried it all they ruined something that 
            was worthwhile carrying on with.' <BR><BR>Heatherington added, 'My 
            attitude has always been that it's all over now, and what we'll do 
            is quickly get our lives back together again. I don't want people 
            bringing back something that happened six or seven months ago. What 
            we're doing now, Dave and I, is improving on megagames to produce 
            something quite startling. We want to bow out at the top.' 
            <BR><BR>In summing up his unique experience in watching the death of 
            the software giant, BBC director Paul Andersen said, 'It was a 
            fascinating time in a city at the focus of the software business. 
            It's a shame it all fell apart - there were a lot of talented people 
            there who were let down. It's a bit like a movie that never got 
            made, all the technicians and all the energy, but the producers 
            failed. It's going to be interesting to see what will come of them 
            all.' <BR><BR>With the finish of Imagine, the TV programme may have 
            looked as though it was over too. However Ocean bought a major 
            portion of Imagine's assets and so Paul Andersen had a finale thrown 
            in his lap. Filming continued at Ocean's offices in Manchester, as 
            they worked on Hunchback II. The BBC may not have got the story of 
            the Imagine megagames, but at least they managed to follow the 
            development of computer games from concept to release, and in the 
            process they saw a fascinating slice of corporate life.

            <BR><BR><B>AFTER IMAGINE</B><BR>So what happened to the remnants of 
            the Imagine team? <BR><BR>Of the big four at the head of Imagine, 
            there is only one real success story amongst them. Ian Hetherington 
            formed <B><A href="http://www.psygnosis.com/" target=link>Psygnosis 
            Games</A></B> which made him the millionaire he always dreamed of 
            being. Having pioneered Playstation software, Hetherington sold 
            Psygnosis to Sony and quit to form <A 
            href="http://www.evostudios.com/" target=link><B>Evolution 
            Software</B></A>. Amazing to think that someone who was so inept at 
            managing the finances of Imagine could reach such 
            heights.<BR><BR>David Lawson appears to have worked on at least one 
            game in the early days of Psygnosis, although according to <A 
            href="http://www.kendalls.demon.co.uk/cssfaq/index.html" 
            target=link><B>Phillip Kendall</A></B>, he was last seen running 
            Kinetica Software in Birkenhead. <BR><BR>Mark Butler was made a 
            director of Odin Computer Graphics, having worked as a freelance 
            consultant for Thor, the software publish company. Shortly after 
            their formation, Butler was forced to leave Odin because of his 
            disagreeable behaviour. As of 6 years ago, Mark Butler was running a 
            development team in London. Whether he still is, I do not 
            know.<BR><BR>In 1985, Bruce Everiss was made Managing Director of 
            Tansoft, owners of Oric Computers and oversaw yet another disaster 
            as they collapsed (see <A
