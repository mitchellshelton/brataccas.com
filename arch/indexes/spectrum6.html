      long ago, amidst the usual frenzied activity of the YS offices, a phone 
      call came through from someone claiming to be a PR man from one of the 
      better- known software houses. Suspicion was immediate! Usually, these 
      people have to be tracked down and meagre morsels of information prized 
      from the protected storage systems they have for minds with the skill of a 
      practised psychoanalyst. <BR>

      <H3>WHO'S KIDDING WHO?</H3>However, this particularly nervous specimen 
      (who announced himself as Philip Thompson of Software Projects) could 
      hardly stop gibbering away; over an hour-long conversation, he gave us the 
      'low-down' on what sounded like some interesting new programs currently 
      being written - and also some surprising stuff on <I>Jet Set Willy</I>. 
      <BR>He mentioned two games - <I>Jet Set Willy Meets The Taxman</I> and 
      <I>Miner Willy And Dr Jones</I> - and alleged both to be the new 
      brainchildren of Matthew Smith. He continued by claiming a real-life 
      connection between Smith and Jones, suggesting (rather unkindly) that the 
      good doctor was Matthew's psychiatrist. And for anyone who's spent hours 
      trying to collect all the objects in <I>Jet Set Willy</I>, Thompson 
      offered the advice, "It's only necessary to pick up half of them to win". 
      <BR>But here's the rub. When we tried to telephone Mr Thompson to verify 
      some of his comments, a confused receptionist from Software Projects 
      declared, "I don't think we've got anyone of that name here". After a few 
      minutes' double checking, she came back with denials from Alan Maton, 
      Chris Lyle and Cohn Stokes - all of whom ought to know! In fact, a chat 
      with Chris not only confirmed Thompson's non- existence, but also that 
      there was no substance to any of his 'inside' information. However, it was 
      confirmed that Matthew is working on a third, and perhaps final, game in 
      the <I>Willy</I> series. <BR>But who is Philip Thompson? Well, further 
      excavation work revealed some interesting new information. It appears that 
      a number of software houses have been receiving strange telephone calls 
      from someone who assumes a different persona in each case; sometimes, for 
      instance, the caller claims to be a <I>Times</I> journalist. The only lead

    <TD width=210>we've had so far is from a rather Imaginative source who 
      reckons that it's John Philips from Bug-Byte - the company that produced 
      Matthew's original bestseller, <I>Manic Miner</I>, before he moved on to 
      Software Projects. John came up with a pretty earthy reply to these 
      accusations ... the gist of it was "it weren't me, guv!". <BR>

      <H3>TWO MORE FROM A&amp;F</H3>Back in the real world, we hear A&amp;F 
      Software is working on a couple of new programs due for release in the 
      late summer or early autumn. The first is called <I>Cylon Attack</I>, a 3D 
      space fight where the player views approaching targets from the window of 
      the cockpit; these increase in size the closer they come. There's also a 
      radar screen to help you locate the enemy - but you'll also have to keep a 
      careful eye on the other gauges, because it's necessary now and then to 
      quickly nip back to the mothership. <BR>The second program sounds even 
      better, according to the great wall of surrounding secrecy. Says A&amp;F 
      spokesman, Martin Hinkling, "It's a brilliant idea, and we've already got 
      a lot of the graphics done. But I can't say any more at the moment for 
      fear of our competitors". More information is promised around August. <BR>

      <H3>IMAGINE TAKES THE PLUNGE</H3>It now looks like the retail price of 
      Imagine's new megagame ( <I>Bandersnatch</I> ) will be about £40. But for 
      this you'll be getting an A4-sized box weighing 2-3lbs containing around 
      30 goodies, including a customised piece of hardware that will allow the 
      accompanying software to provide 20-30 times the playing power of a normal 
      game. <BR>Says Imagine's Bruce Everiss, "We've got ten professional 
      artists working on the graphics, as well as a couple of professional 
      writers who are producing the documentation. The finished product, which 
      includes 11 entirely new concepts in computer games, will certainly exceed 
      everyone's expectations" The launch date remains sometime in August.

      <H3>ON THE OCEAN WAVE</H3>Currently undergoing manufacture at Rabbit 
      Software <I>is Jolly Roger</I>, a saga of salty life at the helm. Says 
      Rabbit director, Terry Grant, "It features a jolly Jack Tar sort of 
      character whose ultimate goal is to locate and collect the masses of 
      hidden treasure." Unfortunately, but quite understandably, this is kept 
      behind locked doors. So the first thing to do is find all the keys; having 
      got a bunch together (there are about 50 rooms, or cabins) you then begin 
      the search. <BR>Of course, it's not quite <I>that</I> simple. As the poor 
      fellow scours the ship he encounters such horrors as energetic pirates, 
      parrots and rats (not to mention a character called Heather and a rugby 
      team - but then, that could be part of another story). What they do with 
      him when they catch him remains to be seen, possibly around the beginning 
      of August. <BR>

      <H3>AUTOMATA CASTAWAY</H3>The irrepressible Mel Croucher and his 
      colleagues from Automata are staying very tight-lipped over something 
      they're calling <I>Crusoe</I>. All they'll say at the moment is that it's 
      an extremely funny adventure, and a bit better than <I>Valhalla</I>. 
      Presumably, too, it's safe to assume some sort of connection with the 
      famous shipwreck victim. <BR>Bad news for fans of previous Automata 
      releases is that poor old Pi-man has been left out in the cold; he's 
      probably heading back to his home in the Greek alphabet. Anyway, 
      <I>Crusoe</I> should be in the shops over the next couple of months, and 
      will retail for £6. <BR>

      <H3>NEW FROM INTERSTELLA</H3>New games outfit, Interstella Software, whose 
      first game - <I>Defenda</I> - is reviewed in this issue, is working on a 
      'question and answer' series entitled <I>A Question Of</I> ... something; 
      sport will probably form the first 'something' (as if you hadn't 
      guessed!). It'll feature an egg timer that shows how much time you've got 
      left as well as a thermometer for taking your temperature. <BR>Selling at 
      £5.50, the program is being written by one of the directors, Peter 
      Stevens, and will read-in up to 2,000 questions from tape, in four blocks 
      of 500. <BR>The other half of the Interstella partnership is Alan Lloyd. 
      He's the one responsible for <I>Defenda</I> and is at present working on a 
      <I>Junior Kong</I> game that we're assured will be more professional than 
      his first effort; his partner says, "He's got better since then" This 
      should be available over the next few weeks, price £5.50.
