<P><FONT color=#000000>Bandersnatch was Imagine's new "mega-game" costing £30 
when completed, which was to include a hardware add-on. The game was far from 
being complete when the company went bust. A new company called Finchspeed was 
set-up after Imagine folded which sold the rights to the game to Sinclair 
Research Ltd. A complete working version was then developed for the QL before 
Finchspeed folded. The directors Dave Lawson and Ian Heatherington then formed 
Psygnosis and the game was later released for the Amiga/ST as 
Brataccas.</FONT></P>
