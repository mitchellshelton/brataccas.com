Concepts <BR>4055 W. Show, #108 <BR>Fresno, CA 93711 <BR>(209) 227-8369 
<BR>$49.95 
<P>Reviewed by Michael Fleischmann 
<P>Holmes &amp; Duckworth, those pseudo-Victorian "micronomists" from Mirage 
Concepts, have introduced a complete Forth package for only $49.95. Yes, I said 
complete. 
<P><B>H&amp;D Forth</B> is based on the Forth-83 standards and allows access to 
all of the ST's memory and GEM commands, as well as supporting the ST graphics, 
MIDI, and printer commands. For those of you who are forever losing your manuals 
or writing all over the pages, this documentation comes on disk so you can print 
it out at your leisure. Wait-there's more. H&amp;D Forth also supports both 
floating point and integer math, all code is fully relocatable <I>and</I> there 
is a run-time turnkey system for developers at no extra charge. 
<P>If you are unfamiliar with Forth, it is a language that has the high-level 
convenience of BASIC but runs at assembly speeds. In Forth you define words to 
have specific meanings. Once these words are defined they become part of the 
language and are useable from that point on. In a very short time you can have a 
language customized to your own personal preferences. 
<P>One drawback to Forth is that it is an RPN or "postfix" language, which means 
the values occur first and the operators follow. For example (1+3)*4 in BASIC 
looks like 1 3 + 4 * in Forth-which does take some getting use to. The authors 
of H&amp;D Forth, however, do give several excellent suggestions for what Forth 
books to get to learn the language. 
<P>Holmes &amp; Duckworth originally used this Forth for their own software 
development. In fact, their new H&amp;D Base is written with it. This new 
package is quite programmer oriented. The screen editor is easy to use-though 
somewhat crude. The source code for the Forth is on the disk and a simple kernel 
is provided for those of you wanting to do applications software. 
<P>H&amp;D Forth deviates from the Forth-83 standard in a few ways: The first is 
that H&amp;D Forth's stack is 32 bits wide, so there are no double words (32 
bits) because they are that way by default. However, this is a valid 
consideration since it gives the programmer access to all of the ST 's memory. 
Another deviation is that multiple dictionaries are not allowed. This decision 
stems from the fact that Holmes &amp; Duckworth have used Forth for several 
years and never had need of them. Other than these two deviations, this Forth is 
a complete standard with enhancements to take care of unique ST items. 
<P>H&amp;D Forth supports all the standard file commands (open, close, seek, 
read, and write) and includes simple mouse and graphics drivers. The most 
impressive aspect of this Forth is the "turnkey" system. This means after you 
are confident you are ready to release your software to the public, you run a 
little program which turns your code and the supporting code into a hidden 
format that cannot be read as source. The memory image is then saved to disk. 
<P>The concise H&amp;D Forth on-disk manual is intended to instruct you how to 
use this version of Forth, not to teach you the language from scratch. I was 
quite impressed with its straightforwardness. It gave me the information I 
needed to know without wasting my time trying to tell me how to turn -my 
computer on. 
<P>The three most important things you need to know are on the first two pages: 
1. Back up the disk and run on a copy. 2. Where to go for technical help. 3. 
There are no royalties to be paid if you use this Forth. The manual then tells 
you how to boot the Forth and how to get the Forth source listings, ending with 
the dictionary of the Forth language. Although brief, the manual is thorough, 
and with the source listings it makes an informative package. 
<P>In summary, I give this implementation of Forth quite high ratings. It does 
everything a Forth processor is supposed to do, it is affordable, it is well 
supported, and it is easy to use. If you are considering Forth for the ST this 
is your best. It's one of the best buys that I have seen. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>BRATACCAS</FONT></B> <BR>Psygnosis Limited <BR>US 
Distributor: Mindscape, Inc. <BR>3444 Dundee Road <BR>Northbrook, IL 60062 
<BR>(312) 480-7667 <BR>$49.95 
<P>Reviewed by Michael Fleischmann 
<P><B>Brataccas</B> by England's Psygnosis Limited is an animated adventure game 
with ambitious graphics. Your character is Kyne, a hero with a price on his 
head. You move through many rooms, gather proof of a government plot and try to 
stay alive. Meanwhile, the 60-odd inhabitants of this world are moving as 
well-and time rolls on. 
<P>Kyne is a genetic engineer who developed a way to make a super-being in the 
hopes of improving the quality of life for his fellow man. But the government 
has decided that a race of super killing machines is a better use for Kyne's 
discoveries. Kyne, on learning this, refuses to continue his work or reveal what 
he had already learned. Thus, he must go into hiding. 
<P>The government issues a warrant for Kyne's arrest, frames him for a crime he 
did not commit, and puts out a contract for him with the underworld. A bit of 
overkill here. Everyone is out to get this guy. 
<P>While fleeing, Kyne discovers that Brataccas-a small mining asteroid- might 
hold the answers he needs, so he ends up there. As Kyne, you must find this 
proof and get it to the proper authorities. 
<P>Brataccas, the first colonized asteroid, has become a favorite haunt for 
miners. With miners comes money and with money comes corruption. The main things 
the residents of Brataccas understand are bribery, corruption and opportunism. 
They also enjoy killing each other-which does make staying alive a problem. In 
other words, Brataccas is a very rough neighborhood to go snooping around in. 
<P>This game comes on an auto-boot disk. While loading, some nice music plays to 
give you something to listen to. Then the screen prompts you to press any key to 
start. As the music fades, your screen changes to show Kyne appearing in the 
arrivals bay. 
<P>At this point you can start playing or press the [HELP] key to display the 
options menu. This menu is very important as it pauses the action, allows you to 
set up how you will control Kyne, and gives you the ability to save and restore 
a game. It also has a movie mode which puts Kyne on auto-pilot and he plays the 
game himself. 
<P>I found the animation to be quite good and smooth. The scenery is well 
thought out and detailed. You can even see another planet (moon? asteroid?) 
setting through a window. The city is fairly vast with lots of rooms to explore 
and quite a few to figure out how to to get into without dying. 
<P>Now the bad news. It seems obvious to me that the main programming effort for 
Brataccas was put into the animation and not into the player interface. If you 
buy the game, don't even bother trying to play it with a joystick or mouse. 
Controlling Kyne reliably with either of these in a critical situation is nearly 
impossible. And even with the keyboard it takes a lot of practice. 
<P>The animation slows down to a crawl if more than two characters are on screen 
at the same time. Another bothersome trait is that if you fall down from a 
raised area all the items you are carrying will drop to the floor and the other 
characters try to pick them up. (Some might consider this a feature, but I found 
it very annoying.) 
<P>If you want to pick up anything off the floor, you had better have patience. 
One time, it took me twenty tries to get an object off the floor. Objects are 
another irritation. Even though you are carrying the objects you cannot examine 
them, read them, or do anything else with them but drop them. 
<P>The authors say their interface "implies action," which means that the game 
tries to sense what you want to do and will proceed to do it for you. Most of 
the time for me, it meant running into walls at full speed. 
<P>Talking to other characters is another matter. You cannot speak to any other 
character unless they address you first. When you do get a chance to talk, don't 
be too near the other character as your ballon (just like in the comics) goes 
over the top of theirs so you end up guessing what the other was saying. 
<P>To sum it all up, for all its impressive graphics and hi-tech, Blade Runner 
plotline, I really can't say Brataccas is one of my favorites. It's too slow for 
arcade action and too limited for an adventure. It was fun, but less so than I 
would expect. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would have to give it a 5.

7287 <BR>Mountain View, CA 94039 <BR>(415) 960-0410 <BR>$49.95 
<P>Reviewed by Sol Guber 
<P>It's 1934. You are Sam Harlow, private eye. Nice guy, usually, but someone 
wants you dead. Guess who? Think fast. You're living on <B>Borrowed Time</B>. 
<P>Borrowed Time is an illustrated text adventure game that has several very 
nice gimmicks which set it above the average. The illustrations enhance both the 
story and the puzzle. Two essentials for solving the mystery are a map of the 
town and a dossier of the approximately 30 characters in this morality play. 
<P>Borrowed Time is very well written and much thought and effort went into 
making the game very playable. This version used all the Atari 520ST's strengths 
admirably. 
<P>There are over 100 pictures in this game and the graphics are excellent, 
subtly utilizing all 16 available colors to good advantage. Scenes are loaded 
from the disk when any room or area is observed. However, after a room is 
vacated the picture is still stored in RAM. So upon returning to a room, the 
picture appears instantly. 
<P>Due to the difficulty of the various puzzles, the picture appearing most 
often is the killer, a truly frightening thug. The second most common picture-of 
which there are five versions-are the tops of your scuffed, size-12 brogues. 
Harlow seems to like putting his foot into places where it does not 
belong-including his mouth. 
<P>There is a slight amount of animation in many of the pictures, as well as a 
sense of humor. For example, there is a blind newsstand vendor wearing dark 
glasses. Of course, his dog has dark glasses and wags his tail in the picture. 
Boss Farnham waves his finger at you, water glugs in the glass bottle, and the 
woman knitting in the doctor's office moves her knitting needles. 
<P>Activision has designed a nice mouse interface for their adventure games. The 
pictures use about two-thirds of the top half of the screen. There is a list on 
the right side of the screen of frequently used action and object words. Click 
on any of the words, and they appear within the typing area. The mouse can also 
be used to pick up and discard objects. Your inventory of objects is always 
displayed in a bar in the center of the screen. 
<P>Activision has also made the game even easier to play by using the function 
keys for shortcuts to perform many frequent actions. Function keys handle such 
things as: SAVE GAME, LOAD GAME, TELL ME ABOUT __, DROP __, QUICKSAVE, 
QUICKLOAD, etc. While this does not make the puzzle any easier, it does make for 
more convenient playing. QUICKSAVE, for example, should definitely be used if 
you hear someone breathing down your neck-or a gun being cocked-and you want to 
get away in a hurry. Remember, you are living on Borrowed Time. 
<P>Two disks come with this game. I wish to commend Activision for putting the 
saves on the second disk. It becomes cumbersome to have a two-disk game plus a 
third disk for saving the game. 
<P>Borrowed Time is a good adventure. It is of moderate difficulty. The pictures 
are excellent. The story is good. It will take a great deal of effort to solve 
the puzzle and see all the illustrations. The use of the mouse is very 
effective. The use of the list of words on the screen is distracting after a 
bit, but does save some typing. Activision has done an excellent job with 
Borrowed Time. You will spend many enjoyable hours in 1934. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H2>New Products</H2>Hippopotamus Software stopped by the <B>ST Resource</B> 
offices to demonstrate one of the hottest products we've seen for the ST yet, 
<B>HippoVision</B> (tentatively $139.95). Yes, it's a video digitizer that can 
digitize images from any standard video signal-TV, videocamera, VCR, etc. The 
beta test version that we saw worked in low or high resolution. The screen 
refresh rate was fast enough to actually watch moving digitized pictures on the 
ST. Any captured picture is saved in DEGAS or NEOchrome format for later fun. 
Also, HippoVision is the first product to use the ST cartridge port.

<P>Major databases are beginning to appear for the ST. <B>H &amp; D Base</B> 
($99.95) from Mirage Concepts, is a relational database program compatible with 
dBase II. The fascinating twist to this product is that, because it is written 
in Forth, you can "turn on" the Forth language and program in Forth as well as 
dBase. You can also access GEM commands in this manner.

<P><B>The Manager</B> is a powerhouse relational database system from the 
Canadian firm of BMB Compuscience. Priced tentatively at $169.95 (with a $149.95 
introductory tag), The Manager is described by its creators as a "paperless 
office" which will offer mainframe capability with virtually unlimited storage. 
This is no small software package. The Manager comes with six disks. And yet it 
can still be used on a 520ST with TOS in RAM.
