    </font></b></u></p>
  <p><font size="-1">You are now Kyne. Kyne is our hero.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Kyne is a fugitive, a man with a price on his head. Framed 
    for a deed he did not commit; that dreadful felony genetic fraud -- 'The Crime 
    Against Humanity'. He is now hunted by authority and underworld alike.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Kyne was a government scientist, a genetic engineer. A brilliant 
    and creative worker, he developed a process for the creation of a superbeing. 
    Naively, Kyne hoped his creation would be put to work for the benefit of mankind 
    but predictably it was not to be so. The government in their infinite wisdom 
    had decided that a race of killing machines, an army of domination and death, 
    was an apt use for such technology.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Faced with such a prospect, Kyne stopped work and refusing 
    to reveal details of his research went into hiding, choosing to forsake his 
    career rather than work on a project so repugnant to his morals.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The government issued a warrant for Kyne's arrest claiming 
    that he was plotting to sell these genetic techniques to the underworld, thus 
    making him guilty of crimes against the human race. Instructing security forces 
    throughout the Earth system, to find him at all costs, the government declared 
    him dangerous -- wanted dead or alive.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Meanwhile the underworld's interest was aroused. As a fugitive 
    he might be persuaded to work for them; his skills had many diabolical uses 
    and if he did not submit, they could always sell his corpse to the authorities. 
    And so the forces of lawlessness joined in the search.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Kyne, forced to flee from Earth, now knew that he must clear 
    his name and expose the government -- the alternative was to face a life of 
    hiding, living with the fear of death or imprisonment. He knew that somewhere 
    evidence must exist and all of his searches led to one place, a small mining 
    asteroid in the outer Solar System .... Brataccas!!!</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">You are Kyne, but can you survive the Brataccas experience 
    . . . . </font></p>
